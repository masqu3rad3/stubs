    Create, edit, or query a camera with the specified properties.

    Args:
        aspectRatio: (create, edit, query) - The ratio of the film back width to the film back height.
        cameraScale: (create, edit, query) - Scale the camera.
        centerOfInterest: (create, edit, query) - Set the linear distance from the camera's eye point to the center of interest.
        clippingPlanes: (create, edit, query) - Activate manual clipping planes.
        depthOfField: (create, edit, query) - Determines whether a depth of field calculation is performed to give varying focus depending on the distance of the objects.
        displayFieldChart: (create, edit, query) - Activate display of the video field chart when looking through the camera.
        displayFilmGate: (create, edit, query) - Activate display of the film gate icons when looking through the camera.

        displaySafeTitle: (create, edit, query) - Activate display of the video Safe Title guide when looking through the camera.
        fStop: (create, edit, query) - A real lens normally contains a diaphragm or other stop which blocks some of the light that would otherwise pass through it. This stop is usually approximately round, and its diameter as seen from the front of the lens is called the lens diameter. The lens diameter is often described by its relation to the focal length of the lens. A lens whose diameter is one-eighth its local length is said to have an F-stop of 8. This is an optical property of the lens.
        farClipPlane: (create, edit, query) - Specify the distance to the far clipping plane.
        farFocusDistance: (create, edit, query) - Linear distance to the far focus plane.
        filmFit: (create, edit, query) - This describes how the digital image (in pixels) relates to the film back. Since the film back is defined in terms of real numbers with some arbitrary film aspect, and the digital image is defined in integer pixels with an equally arbitrary (and different) resolution, relating the two can get complicated. There are 4 choices:   horizontal  In this case the digital image is made to fit the film back exactly in the horizontal direction. This then gives each pixel a horizontal size = (film back width) / (horizontal resolution). The pixel height is then = (pixel width) / (pixel aspect ratio). Now that the pixel has a size, resolution gives us a complete image. That image will match the film back exactly in width. It will almost never match in height, either being too tall or too short. By playing with the numbers you can get it pretty close though. vertical This is the same idea as horizontal fit, only applied vertically. Thus the digital image will match the film back exactly in height, but miss in width. fill This is a convenience item. The system calculates both horizontal and vertical fits and then applies the one that makes the digital image larger than the film back. overscan Overscanning the film gate in the camera view allows us to choreograph action outside of the frustum from within the camera view without having to resort to a dolly or zoom. This feature is also essential for animating image planes.
        filmFitOffset: (create, edit, query) - Since we know from the above that the digital image may not match the film back exactly, we now have the question of how to position one relative to the other. Thus fit offset. Normally the centers are aligned. Fit offset lets you move the smaller image within the larger one. Specify the distance for film offset (inches).
        filmRollOrder: (create, edit, query) - Specifies how the roll is applied with respect to the pivot value.  Rotate-Translate The film back is first rotated then translated by the pivot point value. Translate-Rotate The film back is first translated then rotated by the film roll value.
        filmRollValue: (create, edit, query) - This specifies that amount of rotation around the film back. The roll value is specified in degrees. The rotation occurs around the specified pivot point. This value is used to compute a film roll matrix, which is a component of the post-projection matrix.
        filmTranslateH: (create, edit, query) - The horizontal film translation. Values are normalized to the viewing area.
        filmTranslateV: (create, edit, query) - The vertical film translation. Values are normalized to the viewing area.
        focalLength: (create, edit, query) - This is the distance along the lens axis between the lens and the film plane when "focal distance" is infinitely large. This is an optical property of the lens. This double precision parameter is always specified in millimeters.
        focusDistance: (create, edit, query) - Set the focus at a certain distance in front of the camera.
        homeCommand: (create, edit, query) - Specify the command to execute when "viewSet -home" is applied to this camera. All occurances of "%camera" will be replaced with the cameras name before viewSet runs the command.
        horizontalFieldOfView: (create, edit, query) - This is the film back width as seen by the lens when focused at infinity (ie., focal length away) measured as an angle. Note that it has nothing to do with pixels or the digital image or any aspects. Angle of view is a derived field, that is, it is not used internally by Alias and can be completely determined from other information. It is included as a convenience for the user. Its derivation is aov = 2 * atan( fbw / (2 * f) ) where "aov" is the angle of view, "fbw" is the film back width and "f" is the focal length.
        horizontalFilmAperture: (create, edit, query) - The horizontal width of the camera's film plane. The camera's film is located on the film plane. The extent of the film which will be exposed to an image of the scene in front of the lens is limited to a rectangular area described by the film back. This double precision parameter is always specified in inches.
        horizontalFilmOffset: (create, edit, query) - Horizontal offset from the center of the film back. Normally the film back will be centered on the lens axis. However, this need not be so. Film offset is the displacement of the center of the film back from the lens axis, also measured in inches. Note that offsetting the film back will distort the image, but will not alter the focus. This double precision parameter is always specified in inches.
        horizontalPan: (create, edit, query) - Horizontal 2D camera pan (inches)
        horizontalRollPivot: (create, edit, query) - The horizontal pivot point from the center of the film back. The pivot point is used during rotation of the film back.  The pivot is the point where the rotation occurs around. This double precision parameter corresponds to the normalized viewport. This value is a part of the post projection matrix.
        horizontalShake: (create, edit, query) - Another horizontal offset from the center of the film back, which can be used and stored on the camera in addition to the horizonal film offset attribute.  This allows for film-based camera shake internal to the camera.  This works in exactly the same units and coordinates that the film offset attribute does. The effect of this attribute is toggled by the shake enabled attribute.
        journalCommand: (create, edit, query) - Journal interactive camera commands. Commands can be undone when a camera is journaled.
        lensSqueezeRatio: (create, edit, query) - This is presently just an information field in the camera editor is meant to convey the horizontal distortion of the anamorphic lens normally used with some film formats. If it were used, it would do something like pixel aspect. Remember however that lens distortion (intentional or not) is slightly different than the output hardware's quantization. The fact that a "net" distortion parameter could be used for both may or may not confuse the issue.
        lockTransform: (create, edit, query) - Lock the camera. When a camera is locked, its transformation information, that is, its Translate and Rotate properties cannot be adjusted, and the center of interest point cannot be moved. For orthographic cameras, Orthographic Width is also locked. For camera groups, Aim and Up locator's translate is also locked. For stereo cameras, the root camera is locked.
        motionBlur: (create, edit, query) - Determines whether the camera's image is motion blured (as opposed to an object's image). For example, if you want to blur the camera movement when you are performing a flyby.
        name: (create, edit, query) - Name of the camera.
        nearClipPlane: (create, edit, query) - Specify the distance to the NEAR clipping plane.
        nearFocusDistance: (create, edit, query) - Linear distance to the near focus plane.
        orthographic: (create, edit, query) - Activate the orthographic camera.
        orthographicWidth: (create, edit, query) - Set the orthographic projection width.
        overscan: (create, edit, query) - Set the percent of overscan.
        panZoomEnabled: (create, edit, query) - Toggle camera 2D pan and zoom
        position: (create, edit, query) - Three linear values can be specified to translate the camera.
        postScale: (create, edit, query) - The post-scale value.  This value multiplied against the computed projection matrix. It is applied after the the film roll.
        preScale: (create, edit, query) - The pre-scale value. The value is multiplied against the computed projection matrix. It is applied before the film roll.
        renderPanZoom: (create, edit, query) - Toggle camera 2D pan and zoom in render
        rotation: (create, edit, query) - Three angular values can be specified to rotate the camera.
        shakeEnabled: (create, edit, query) - Toggles the effect of the horizontal and vertical shake attributes.
        shakeOverscan: (create, edit, query) - Controls the amount of overscan in the output rendered image. For use when adding film-based camera shake.  Acts as a multiplier to the film aperture on the camera.
        shakeOverscanEnabled: (create, edit, query) - Toggles the effect of the shake overscan attribute.
        shutterAngle: (create, edit, query) - Specify the shutter angle (degrees).
        startupCamera: (create, edit, query) - A startup camera is marked undeletable and implicit. This flag can be used to set or query the startup state of a camera. There must always be at least one startup camera.
        stereoHorizontalImageTranslate: (create, edit, query) - A film-back offset for use in stereo camera rigs.
        stereoHorizontalImageTranslateEnabled: (create, edit, query) - Toggles the effect of the stereo HIT attribute.

        verticalFilmAperture: (create, edit, query) - The vertical height of the camera's film plane. This double precision parameter is always specified in inches.
        verticalFilmOffset: (create, edit, query) - Vertical offset from the center of the film back. This double precision parameter is always specified in inches.
        verticalLock: (create, edit, query) - Lock the size of the vertical film aperture.
        verticalPan: (create, edit, query) - Vertical 2D camera pan (inches)
        verticalRollPivot: (create, edit, query) - Vertical pivot point used for rotating the film back. This double precision parameter corresponds to the normalized viewport. This value is used to compute the film roll matrix, which is a component of the post projection matrix.
        verticalShake: (create, edit, query) - Vertical offset from the center of the film back.  See horizontal shake attribute description.  This is toggled by the shake enabled attribute.

        backgroundMode: (create) - Defines how the background of the texture should be filled. Three modes are available: "shader" or 1: uses the default shader color. "color" or 2: uses the color given by -backgroundColor flag. "extend" or 3: extends outwards the color along the seam edges. Default is "shader".
        camera: (create) - Specify a camera to use in baking lighting. If a camera is not specified the camera in the active view will be used.
        componentRange: (create) - If one or more components have been selected to use, then if this flag is set, then the uv range of the components is used to fit into the texture map resolution. By default this flag is set to false.
        doubleSided: (create) - Specify whether the sampler should flip the surface normal if the sample point faces away from the camera. Note: flipping the normal will make the result dependent on the camera (ie. one camera may flip normals where different camera wouldn't). It's not recommended that doubleSided be used in combination with shadows. By default this flag is false.
        fileFormat: (create) - File format to be used for output. IFF is the default if unspecified. Other valid formats are: als: Alias PIX cin: Cineon eps: EPS gif: GIF iff: Maya IFF jpg: JPEG yuv: Quantel rla: Wavefront RLA sgi: SGI si: SoftImage (.pic) tga: Targa tif: TIFF bmp: Windows Bitmap
        fileImageName: (create) - Specify the output path and name of file texture image. If the file name doesn't contain a directory separator, the image will be written to source images of the current project. The file will not be versioned if it already exists.
        fillTextureSeams: (create) - Specify whether or not to overscan the polygon beyond its outer edges, when creating the file texture, in order to fill the texture seams. Default is true.
        force: (create) - If the output image already exists overwrite it. By default this flag is off.
        fullUvRange: (create) - Sample using the full uv range of the surface. This flag cannot be used with the -uvr flag. A 2D texture placement node will be created and connected to the file texture. The placement's translate and coverage will be set according to the full UV range of the surface.
        name: (create) - Set the name of the file texture node. Name conflict resolution will be used to determine valid names when multiple objects are specified.
        pixelFormat: (create) - Specifies the pixel format of the image. Note that not all file formats support all pixel formats. Available options: "8": 8 bits per channel, unsigned (0-255) "16": 16 bits per channel, unsigned (0-65535) Default is "8".
        resolutionX: (create) - Set the horizontal image resolution. If this flag is not specified, the resolution will be set to 256.
        resolutionY: (create) - Set the vertical image resolution. If this flag is not specified, the resolution will be set to 256.
        reuseDepthMap: (create) - Specify whether or not to reuse all the generated dmaps. Default is false.
        samplePlane: (create) - Specify whether to sample using a virtual plane. This virtual plane has texture coordinates in the rectangle defined by the -samplePlaneRange flag. If the -samplePlaneRange flag is not set then the virtual plane defaults to having texture coordinates in the (0,0) to (1,1) square. If this option is set than all surface based arguments will be ignored.
        samplePlaneRange: (create) - Specify the uv range of the texture coordinates used to sample if the -samplePlane option is set. There are four arguments corresponding to uMin, uMax, vMin and vMax. By default the virtual plane is from uMin 0 to uMax 1, and vMin 0 to vMax 1.
        shadows: (create) - Specify whether to compute shadows when baking lighting. Disk based shadow maps will be used. Only lights with depth map shadows enabled will contribute to the shading. By default shadows are not computed.
        uvBBoxIntersect: (create) - This flag is obsolete.
        uvRange: (create) - Specify the uv range in which samples will be computed. There are four arguments corresponding to uMin, uMax, vMin and vMax. Each value should be specified based on the surface's uv space. A 2D texture placement node will be created and connected to the file texture. The placement's frame translate and coverage will be set according to the uv range specified. By default the entire uv range of the surface will be used.
        uvSetName: (create) - Specify which uv set has to be used as the driving parametrization for convert solid.

        backgroundColor: (create, edit, query) - The background color of the control. The arguments correspond to the red, green, and blue color components. Each component ranges in value from 0.0 to 1.0. When setting backgroundColor, the background is automatically enabled, unless enableBackground is also specified with a false value.
        defineTemplate: (create) - Puts the command in a mode where any other flags and arguments are parsed and added to the command template specified in the argument. They will be used as default arguments in any subsequent invocations of the command when templateName is set as the current template.
        docTag: (create, edit, query) - Add a documentation flag to the control.  The documentation flag has a directory structure. (e.g., -dt render/multiLister/createNode/material)
        dragCallback: (create, edit) - Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:  global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods)  The proc returns a string array that is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type.  Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers CTRL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTRL, 3 == CTRL + SHIFT.  In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form:  def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ):  The values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above.  The other way to specify the callback in Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys "dragControl", "x", "y", "modifiers".  The "dragControl" value is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be "print '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'")
        dropCallback: (create, edit) - Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:  global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int $y, int $type)  The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback. $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link.  In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form:  def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ):  The values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above.  The other way to specify the callback in Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard Python format operator.

        enable: (create, edit, query) - The enable state of the control.  By default, this flag is set to true and the control is enabled.  Specify false and the control will appear dimmed or greyed-out indicating it is disabled.
        enableBackground: (create, edit, query) - Enables the background color of the control.
        enableKeyboardFocus: (create, edit, query) - If enabled, the user can navigate to the control with the tab key and select values with the keyboard or mouse. This flag would typically be used to turn off focus support from controls that get it by default, like Edit and List controls. If disabled, text in text fields can still be selected with the mouse but cannot be copied (except on Linux when "Middle Click Paste" is enabled).
        exists: (create) - Returns whether the specified object exists or not. Other flags are ignored.
        fullPathName: (query) - Return the full path name of the widget, which includes all the parents.
        height: (create, edit, query) - The height of the control.  The control will attempt to be this size if it is not overruled by parent layout conditions.
        highlightColor: (create, edit, query) - The highlight color of the control. The arguments correspond to the red, green, and blue color components. Each component ranges in value from 0.0 to 1.0.
        isObscured: (query) - Return whether the control can actually be seen by the user. The control will be obscured if its state is invisible, if it is blocked (entirely or partially) by some other control, if it or a parent layout is unmanaged, or if the control's window is invisible or iconified.
        label: (create, edit) - Value of the checkbox label
        manage: (create, edit, query) - Manage state of the control.  An unmanaged control is not visible, nor does it take up any screen real estate.  All controls are created managed by default.
        noBackground: (create, edit) - Clear/reset the control's background. Passing true means the background should not be drawn at all, false means the background should be drawn.  The state of this flag is inherited by children of this control.
        numberOfPopupMenus: (query) - Return the number of popup menus attached to this control.
        parent: (create, query) - The parent layout for this control.

The other way to specify the callback in Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys "dragControl", "x", "y", "modifiers".  The "dragControl" value is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be "print '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'")
        dropCallback: (create, edit) - Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:  global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int $y, int $type)  The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback. $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link.  In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form:  def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ):  The values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above.  The other way to specify the callback in Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys "dragControl", "dropControl", "messages", "x", "y", "type".  The "dragControl" value is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be "print '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'")
        enable: (create, edit, query) - The enable state of the control.  By default, this flag is set to true and the control is enabled.  Specify false and the control will appear dimmed or greyed-out indicating it is disabled.
        enableBackground: (create, edit, query) - Enables the background color of the control.
        enableKeyboardFocus: (create, edit, query) - If enabled, the user can navigate to the control with the tab key and select values with the keyboard or mouse. This flag would typically be used to turn off focus support from controls that get it by default, like Edit and List controls. If disabled, text in text fields can still be selected with the mouse but cannot be copied (except on Linux when "Middle Click Paste" is enabled).
        exists: (create) - Returns whether the specified object exists or not. Other flags are ignored.
        fullPathName: (query) - Return the full path name of the widget, which includes all the parents.
        height: (create, edit, query) - The height of the control.  The control will attempt to be this size if it is not overruled by parent layout conditions.
        highlightColor: (create, edit, query) - The highlight color of the control. The arguments correspond to the red, green, and blue color components. Each component ranges in value from 0.0 to 1.0.
        isObscured: (query) - Return whether the control can actually be seen by the user. The control will be obscured if its state is invisible, if it is blocked (entirely or partially) by some other control, if it or a parent layout is unmanaged, or if the control's window is invisible or iconified.
        label: (create, edit) - Value of the checkbox label
        light: (create) - The light that is to be made exclusive/non-exclusive.
        manage: (create, edit, query) - Manage state of the control.  An unmanaged control is not visible, nor does it take up any screen real estate.  All controls are created managed by default.
        noBackground: (create, edit) - Clear/reset the control's background. Passing true means the background should not be drawn at all, false means the background should be drawn.  The state of this flag is inherited by children of this control.
        numberOfPopupMenus: (query) - Return the number of popup menus attached to this control.
        parent: (create, query) - The parent layout for this control.
        popupMenuArray: (query) - Return the names of all the popup menus attached to this control.

        statusBarMessage: (create, edit) - Extra string to display in the status bar when the mouse is over the control.
        useTemplate: (create) - Forces the command to use a command template other than the current one.
        visible: (create, edit, query) - The visible state of the control.  A control is created visible by default.  Note that a control's actual appearance is also dependent on the visible state of its parent layout(s).
        visibleChangeCommand: (create, edit, query) - Command that gets executed when visible state of the control changes.
        width: (create, edit, query) - The width of the control.  The control will attempt to be this size if it is not overruled by parent layout conditions.

    This command creates a 3dPort that displays an image representing the layered shader node specified.

    Args:
        annotation: (create, edit, query) - Annotate the control with an extra string value.
        backgroundColor: (create, edit, query) - The background color of the control. The arguments correspond to the red, green, and blue color components. Each component ranges in value from 0.0 to 1.0. When setting backgroundColor, the background is automatically enabled, unless enableBackground is also specified with a false value.
        defineTemplate: (create) - Puts the command in a mode where any other flags and arguments are parsed and added to the command template specified in the argument. They will be used as default arguments in any subsequent invocations of the command when templateName is set as the current template.
        docTag: (create, edit, query) - Add a documentation flag to the control.  The documentation flag has a directory structure. (e.g., -dt render/multiLister/createNode/material)
        dragCallback: (create, edit) - Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:  global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods)  The proc returns a string array that is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type.  Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers CTRL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTRL, 3 == CTRL + SHIFT.  In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form:  def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ):  The values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above.  The other way to specify the callback in Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys "dragControl", "x", "y", "modifiers".  The "dragControl" value is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be "print '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'")
        dropCallback: (create, edit) - Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:  global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int $y, int $type)  The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback. $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link.  In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form:  def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ):  The values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above.  The other way to specify the callback in Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys "dragControl", "dropControl", "messages", "x", "y", "type".  The "dragControl" value is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be "print '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'")
        enable: (create, edit, query) - The enable state of the control.  By default, this flag is set to true and the control is enabled.  Specify false and the control will appear dimmed or greyed-out indicating it is disabled.
        enableBackground: (create, edit, query) - Enables the background color of the control.
        enableKeyboardFocus: (create, edit, query) - If enabled, the user can navigate to the control with the tab key and select values with the keyboard or mouse. This flag would typically be used to turn off focus support from controls that get it by default, like Edit and List controls. If disabled, text in text fields can still be selected with the mouse but cannot be copied (except on Linux when "Middle Click Paste" is enabled).
        exists: (create) - Returns whether the specified object exists or not. Other flags are ignored.
        fullPathName: (query) - Return the full path name of the widget, which includes all the parents.
        height: (create, edit, query) - The height of the control.  The control will attempt to be this size if it is not overruled by parent layout conditions.
        highlightColor: (create, edit, query) - The highlight color of the control. The arguments correspond to the red, green, and blue color components. Each component ranges in value from 0.0 to 1.0.
        isObscured: (query) - Return whether the control can actually be seen by the user. The control will be obscured if its state is invisible, if it is blocked (entirely or partially) by some other control, if it or a parent layout is unmanaged, or if the control's window is invisible or iconified.
        manage: (create, edit, query) - Manage state of the control.  An unmanaged control is not visible, nor does it take up any screen real estate.  All controls are created managed by default.
        noBackground: (create, edit) - Clear/reset the control's background. Passing true means the background should not be drawn at all, false means the background should be drawn.  The state of this flag is inherited by children of this control.
        node: (create) - Specifies the name of the newLayeredShader node this port will represent.
        numberOfPopupMenus: (query) - Return the number of popup menus attached to this control.
        parent: (create, query) - The parent layout for this control.
        popupMenuArray: (query) - Return the names of all the popup menus attached to this control.
        preventOverride: (create, edit, query) - If true, this flag prevents overriding the control's attribute via the control's right mouse button menu.
        selectedColorControl: (create) - Specifies the name of the UI-control that represents the currently selected layer's color.
        selectedTransparencyControl: (create) - Specifies the name of the UI-control that represents the currently selected layer's transparency.
        statusBarMessage: (create, edit) - Extra string to display in the status bar when the mouse is over the control.
        useTemplate: (create) - Forces the command to use a command template other than the current one.
        visible: (create, edit, query) - The visible state of the control.  A control is created visible by default.  Note that a control's actual appearance is also dependent on the visible state of its parent layout(s).
        visibleChangeCommand: (create, edit, query) - Command that gets executed when visible state of the control changes.
        width: (create, edit, query) - The width of the control.  The control will attempt to be this size if it is not overruled by parent layout conditions.

    This control supports up to 3 icon images and 4 different display styles.  The icon image displayed is the one that best fits the current size of the control given its current style.

    Args:
        align: (create, edit, query) - The label alignment.  Alignment values are "left", "right", and "center". By default, the label is aligned "center". Currently only available when -st/style is set to "iconAndTextCentered".
        annotation: (create, edit, query) - Annotate the control with an extra string value.
        backgroundColor: (create, edit, query) - The background color of the control. The arguments correspond to the red, green, and blue color components. Each component ranges in value from 0.0 to 1.0. When setting backgroundColor, the background is automatically enabled, unless enableBackground is also specified with a false value.
        command: (create, edit, query) - Command executed when the control is pressed. The command should return a string which will be used to facilitate node drag and drop.
        defineTemplate: (create) - Puts the command in a mode where any other flags and arguments are parsed and added to the command template specified in the argument. They will be used as default arguments in any subsequent invocations of the command when templateName is set as the current template.
        disabledImage: (create, edit, query) - Image used when the button is disabled. Image size must be the same as the image specified with the i/image flag. This is a Windows only flag.
        docTag: (create, edit, query) - Add a documentation flag to the control.  The documentation flag has a directory structure. (e.g., -dt render/multiLister/createNode/material)
        dragCallback: (create, edit) - Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:  global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods)  The proc returns a string array that is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type.  Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers CTRL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTRL, 3 == CTRL + SHIFT.  In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form:  def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ):  The values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above.  The other way to specify the callback in Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys "dragControl", "x", "y", "modifiers".  The "dragControl" value is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be "print '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'")
        dropCallback: (create, edit) - Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:  global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int $y, int $type)  The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback. $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link.  In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form:  def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ):  The values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above.  The other way to specify the callback in Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys "dragControl", "dropControl", "messages", "x", "y", "type".  The "dragControl" value is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be "print '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'")
        enable: (create, edit, query) - The enable state of the control.  By default, this flag is set to true and the control is enabled.  Specify false and the control will appear dimmed or greyed-out indicating it is disabled.
        enableBackground: (create, edit, query) - Enables the background color of the control.
        enableKeyboardFocus: (create, edit, query) - If enabled, the user can navigate to the control with the tab key and select values with the keyboard or mouse. This flag would typically be used to turn off focus support from controls that get it by default, like Edit and List controls. If disabled, text in text fields can still be selected with the mouse but cannot be copied (except on Linux when "Middle Click Paste" is enabled).
        exists: (create) - Returns whether the specified object exists or not. Other flags are ignored.
        flipX: (create, edit, query) - Is the image flipped horizontally?
        flipY: (create, edit, query) - Is the image flipped vertically?
        font: (create, edit, query) - The font for the text.  Valid values are "boldLabelFont", "smallBoldLabelFont", "tinyBoldLabelFont", "plainLabelFont", "smallPlainLabelFont", "obliqueLabelFont", "smallObliqueLabelFont", "fixedWidthFont" and "smallFixedWidthFont".
        fullPathName: (query) - Return the full path name of the widget, which includes all the parents.
        height: (create, edit, query) - The height of the control.  The control will attempt to be this size if it is not overruled by parent layout conditions.
        highlightColor: (create, edit, query) - The highlight color of the control. The arguments correspond to the red, green, and blue color components. Each component ranges in value from 0.0 to 1.0.
        image: (create, edit, query) - If you are not providing images with different sizes then you may use this flag for the control's image. If the "iconOnly" style is set, the icon will be scaled to the size of the control.
        image1: (create, edit, query) - First of three possible icons. The icon that best fits the current size of the control will be displayed.
        image2: (create, edit, query) - Second of three possible icons. The icon that best fits the current size of the control will be displayed.
        image3: (create, edit, query) - Third of three possible icons. The icon that best fits the current size of the control will be displayed.
        imageOverlayLabel: (create, edit, query) - A short string, up to 6 characters, representing a label that will be displayed on top of the image.
        isObscured: (query) - Return whether the control can actually be seen by the user. The control will be obscured if its state is invisible, if it is blocked (entirely or partially) by some other control, if it or a parent layout is unmanaged, or if the control's window is invisible or iconified.
        label: (create, edit, query) - The text that appears in the control.
        labelOffset: (create, edit, query) - The label offset. Default is 0. Currently only available when -st/style is set to "iconAndTextCentered".
        manage: (create, edit, query) - Manage state of the control.  An unmanaged control is not visible, nor does it take up any screen real estate.  All controls are created managed by default.
        marginHeight: (create, edit, query) - The number of pixels above and below the control content. The default value is 1 pixel.
        marginWidth: (create, edit, query) - The number of pixels on either side of the control content. The default value is 1 pixel.
        noBackground: (create, edit) - Clear/reset the control's background. Passing true means the background should not be drawn at all, false means the background should be drawn.  The state of this flag is inherited by children of this control.
        numberOfPopupMenus: (query) - Return the number of popup menus attached to this control.
        overlayLabelBackColor: (create, edit, query) - The RGBA color of the shadow behind the label defined by imageOverlayLabel. Default is 50% transparent black: 0 0 0 .5
        overlayLabelColor: (create, edit, query) - The RGB color of the label defined by imageOverlayLabel. Default is a light grey: .8 .8 .8
        parent: (create, query) - The parent layout for this control.
        popupMenuArray: (query) - Return the names of all the popup menus attached to this control.
        preventOverride: (create, edit, query) - If true, this flag prevents overriding the control's attribute via the control's right mouse button menu.
        rotation: (create, edit, query) - The rotation value of the image in radians.
        statusBarMessage: (create, edit) - Extra string to display in the status bar when the mouse is over the control.
        style: (create, edit, query) - The draw style of the control.  Valid styles are "iconOnly", "textOnly", "iconAndTextHorizontal", "iconAndTextVertical", and "iconAndTextCentered". (Note: "iconAndTextCentered" is only available on Windows). If the "iconOnly" style is set, the icon will be scaled to the size of the control.
        useAlpha: (create, edit, query) - Is the image using alpha channel?
        useTemplate: (create) - Forces the command to use a command template other than the current one.
        version: (create, edit, query) - Specify the version that this control feature was introduced. The argument should be given as a string of the version number (e.g. "2013", "2014"). Currently only accepts major version numbers (e.g. 2013 Ext 1, or 2013.5 should be given as "2014").
        visible: (create, edit, query) - The visible state of the control.  A control is created visible by default.  Note that a control's actual appearance is also dependent on the visible state of its parent layout(s).
        visibleChangeCommand: (create, edit, query) - Command that gets executed when visible state of the control changes.
        width: (create, edit, query) - The width of the control.  The control will attempt to be this size if it is not overruled by parent layout conditions.

Later the saved preset can be loaded and applied onto a different node of the same type. The end result is that the node to which the preset is applied takes on the same values as the node from which the preset was generated had at the time of the snapshot.

    Args:
        attributes: (create) - A white space separated string of the named attributes to save to the preset file. If not specified, all attributes will be stored.
        custom: (create) - Specifies a MEL script for custom handling of node attributes that are not handled by the general save preset mechanism (ie. multis, dynamic attributes, or connections). The identifiers #presetName and #nodeName will be expanded before the script is run. The script must return an array of strings which will be saved to the preset file and issued as commands when the preset is applied to another node. The custom script can query #nodeName in determining what should be saved to the preset, or issue commands to query the selected node in deciding how the preset should be applied.
        delete: (create) - Deletes the existing preset for the node specified by the first argument with the name specified by the second argument.
        exists: (create) - Returns true if the node specified by the first argument already has a preset with a name specified by the second argument. This flag can be used to check if the user is about to overwrite an existing preset and thereby provide the user with an opportunity to choose a different name.
        isValidName: (create) - Returns true if the name consists entirely of valid characters for a preset name. Returns false if not. Because the preset name will become part of a file name and part of a MEL procedure name, some characters must be disallowed. Only alphanumeric characters and underscore are valid characters for the preset name.
        list: (create) - Lists the names of all presets which can be loaded onto the specified node.
        load: (create) - Sets the settings of the node specified by the first argument according to the preset specified by the second argument. Any attributes on the node which are the destinations of connections or whose children (multi children or compound children) are destinations of connections will not be changed by the preset.
        save: (create) - Saves the current settings of the node specified by the first argument to a preset of the name specified by the second argument. If a preset for that node with that name already exists, it will be overwritten with no warning. You can use the -exists flag to check if the preset already exists. If an attribute of the node is the destination of a connection, the value of the attribute will not be written as part of the preset.

    Create a psdChannelOutliner control which is capable of displaying a tree structure upto one level.

    Args:
        addChild: (edit, multiuse) - This flag should be used along with the "-psdParent/ppa" flag. A string item gets added as a child to the parent specifed with "-psdParent/ppa" flag. The next string assigns an associated image name.
        allItems: (query) - Returns all the items in the form parent.child.
        annotation: (create, edit, query) - Annotate the control with an extra string value.
        backgroundColor: (create, edit, query) - The background color of the control. The arguments correspond to the red, green, and blue color components. Each component ranges in value from 0.0 to 1.0. When setting backgroundColor, the background is automatically enabled, unless enableBackground is also specified with a false value.
        defineTemplate: (create) - Puts the command in a mode where any other flags and arguments are parsed and added to the command template specified in the argument. They will be used as default arguments in any subsequent invocations of the command when templateName is set as the current template.
        docTag: (create, edit, query) - Add a documentation flag to the control.  The documentation flag has a directory structure. (e.g., -dt render/multiLister/createNode/material)
        doubleClickCommand: (create, edit) - Specify the command to be executed when an item is double clicked.
        dragCallback: (create, edit) - Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:  global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods)  The proc returns a string array that is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type.  Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers CTRL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTRL, 3 == CTRL + SHIFT.  In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form:  def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ):  The values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above.  The other way to specify the callback in Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys "dragControl", "x", "y", "modifiers".  The "dragControl" value is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be "print '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'")
        dropCallback: (create, edit) - Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:  global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int $y, int $type)  The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback. $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link.  In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form:  def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ):  The values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above.  The other way to specify the callback in Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys "dragControl", "dropControl", "messages", "x", "y", "type".  The "dragControl" value is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be "print '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'")
        enable: (create, edit, query) - The enable state of the control.  By default, this flag is set to true and the control is enabled.  Specify false and the control will appear dimmed or greyed-out indicating it is disabled.
        enableBackground: (create, edit, query) - Enables the background color of the control.
        enableKeyboardFocus: (create, edit, query) - If enabled, the user can navigate to the control with the tab key and select values with the keyboard or mouse. This flag would typically be used to turn off focus support from controls that get it by default, like Edit and List controls. If disabled, text in text fields can still be selected with the mouse but cannot be copied (except on Linux when "Middle Click Paste" is enabled).
        exists: (create) - Returns whether the specified object exists or not. Other flags are ignored.
        fullPathName: (query) - Return the full path name of the widget, which includes all the parents.
        height: (create, edit, query) - The height of the control.  The control will attempt to be this size if it is not overruled by parent layout conditions.
        highlightColor: (create, edit, query) - The highlight color of the control. The arguments correspond to the red, green, and blue color components. Each component ranges in value from 0.0 to 1.0.
        isObscured: (query) - Return whether the control can actually be seen by the user. The control will be obscured if its state is invisible, if it is blocked (entirely or partially) by some other control, if it or a parent layout is unmanaged, or if the control's window is invisible or iconified.
        manage: (create, edit, query) - Manage state of the control.  An unmanaged control is not visible, nor does it take up any screen real estate.  All controls are created managed by default.
        noBackground: (create, edit) - Clear/reset the control's background. Passing true means the background should not be drawn at all, false means the background should be drawn.  The state of this flag is inherited by children of this control.

        numberOfPopupMenus: (query) - Return the number of popup menus attached to this control.
        parent: (create, query) - The parent layout for this control.

        selectItem: (query) - Returns the selected items.
        statusBarMessage: (create, edit) - Extra string to display in the status bar when the mouse is over the control.
        useTemplate: (create) - Forces the command to use a command template other than the current one.
        visible: (create, edit, query) - The visible state of the control.  A control is created visible by default.  Note that a control's actual appearance is also dependent on the visible state of its parent layout(s).
        visibleChangeCommand: (create, edit, query) - Command that gets executed when visible state of the control changes.
        width: (create, edit, query) - The width of the control.  The control will attempt to be this size if it is not overruled by parent layout conditions.

        resetViewImage: (create, edit) - The render editor has the capability to render multiple cameras within a single view. This is different from image binning where an image is saved. Multiple image views are useful for comparing two different camera renders side-by-side. The resetViewImage flag tells the editor that it should reset its internal image storage mechanism to the first image. This would happen at the very start of a render view render.
        saveImage: (edit) - save the current Editor Image to memory. Saved Editor Images are stored in an Editor Image Stack. The most recently saved image is stored in position 0, the second most recently saved image in position 1, and so on... To set the current Editor Image to a previously saved image use the "di/displayImage" flag.

        snapshotMode: (create, edit, query) - Get or set the window's snapshot mode.
        stateString: (query) - Query only flag. Returns the MEL command that will create an editor to match the current editor state. The returned command string uses the string variable $editorName in place of a specific name.
        stereo: (create, edit, query) - Puts the editor into stereo image mode.  The effective resolution of the output image is twice the size of the horizontal size. The orientation of the images can be set using the stereoOrientation flag.
        stereoImageOrientation: (create, edit, query) - Specifies the orientation of stereo camera renders.  The first argument specifies the orientation value for the firstleft image and the second argument specifies the orientation value for the right image. The orientation values are 'normal', the image appears as seen throught he camera, or 'mirrored', the image is mirrored horizontally.
        stereoMode: (create, edit, query) - Specifies how the image is displayed in the view.  By default the stereo is rendered with a side by side image.

        toggle: (create, edit, query) - Turns the ground plane display on/off.
        unParent: (create, edit) - Specifies that the editor should be removed from its layout. This cannot be used in query mode.
        unlockMainConnection: (create, edit) - Unlocks the mainConnection, effectively restoring the original mainConnection (if it is still available), and dynamic updates.
        updateMainConnection: (create, edit) - Causes a locked mainConnection to be updated from the orginal mainConnection, but preserves the lock state.
        useTemplate: (create) - Forces the command to use a command template other than the current one.
        viewImageCount: (create, edit, query) - The render editor has the capability to render multiple cameras within a single view. This is different from image binning where an image is saved. Multiple image views are useful for comparing two different camera renders side-by-side. The viewImageCount flag tells the editor that it should prepare its internal image storage mechanism for a given number of views.
        viewTransformName: (edit, query) - Sets/gets the view transform to be applied if color management is enabled in the current view.
        writeImage: (edit) - write the current Editor Image to disk

        backgroundColor: (create, edit, query) - The background color of the control. The arguments correspond to the red, green, and blue color components. Each component ranges in value from 0.0 to 1.0. When setting backgroundColor, the background is automatically enabled, unless enableBackground is also specified with a false value.
        defineTemplate: (create) - Puts the command in a mode where any other flags and arguments are parsed and added to the command template specified in the argument. They will be used as default arguments in any subsequent invocations of the command when templateName is set as the current template.
        docTag: (create, edit, query) - Add a documentation flag to the control.  The documentation flag has a directory structure. (e.g., -dt render/multiLister/createNode/material)
        dragCallback: (create, edit) - Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:  global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods)  The proc returns a string array that is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type.  Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers CTRL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTRL, 3 == CTRL + SHIFT.  In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form:  def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ):  The values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above.  The other way to specify the callback in Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys "dragControl", "x", "y", "modifiers".  The "dragControl" value is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be "print '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'")
        dropCallback: (create, edit) - Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:  global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int $y, int $type)  The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback. $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link.  In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form:  def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ):  The values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above.  The other way to specify the callback in Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys "dragControl", "dropControl", "messages", "x", "y", "type".  The "dragControl" value is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be "print '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'")
        enable: (create, edit, query) - The enable state of the control.  By default, this flag is set to true and the control is enabled.  Specify false and the control will appear dimmed or greyed-out indicating it is disabled.
        enableBackground: (create, edit, query) - Enables the background color of the control.
        enableKeyboardFocus: (create, edit, query) - If enabled, the user can navigate to the control with the tab key and select values with the keyboard or mouse. This flag would typically be used to turn off focus support from controls that get it by default, like Edit and List controls. If disabled, text in text fields can still be selected with the mouse but cannot be copied (except on Linux when "Middle Click Paste" is enabled).
        exists: (create) - Returns whether the specified object exists or not. Other flags are ignored.
        fullPathName: (query) - Return the full path name of the widget, which includes all the parents.
        height: (create, edit, query) - The height of the control.  The control will attempt to be this size if it is not overruled by parent layout conditions.
        highlightColor: (create, edit, query) - The highlight color of the control. The arguments correspond to the red, green, and blue color components. Each component ranges in value from 0.0 to 1.0.
        isObscured: (query) - Return whether the control can actually be seen by the user. The control will be obscured if its state is invisible, if it is blocked (entirely or partially) by some other control, if it or a parent layout is unmanaged, or if the control's window is invisible or iconified.
        manage: (create, edit, query) - Manage state of the control.  An unmanaged control is not visible, nor does it take up any screen real estate.  All controls are created managed by default.
        noBackground: (create, edit) - Clear/reset the control's background. Passing true means the background should not be drawn at all, false means the background should be drawn.  The state of this flag is inherited by children of this control.
        numberOfPopupMenus: (query) - Return the number of popup menus attached to this control.
        parent: (create, query) - The parent layout for this control.
        popupMenuArray: (query) - Return the names of all the popup menus attached to this control.

        statusBarMessage: (create, edit) - Extra string to display in the status bar when the mouse is over the control.
        useTemplate: (create) - Forces the command to use a command template other than the current one.
        visible: (create, edit, query) - The visible state of the control.  A control is created visible by default.  Note that a control's actual appearance is also dependent on the visible state of its parent layout(s).
        visibleChangeCommand: (create, edit, query) - Command that gets executed when visible state of the control changes.
        width: (create, edit, query) - The width of the control.  The control will attempt to be this size if it is not overruled by parent layout conditions.
        widthHeight: (create) - The width and height of the port.

    This command positions the camera to one of the pre-defined positions. If the fit flag is set in conjunction with persp, top, side, or front, the view is "fit" based on the list of selected objects (if there are any) or on all the objects if nothing is selected. Notice that the fit flag cannot be set in conjunction with view along axis commands like viewX. If a camera is not specified, the camera in the active view will be used. If no flag is specified, the camera is set to the home position.

    Args:
        animate: (create) - Specifies that the transition between camera positions should be animated.
        back: (create) - Moves the camera to the back position.
        bottom: (create) - Moves the camera to the bottom position.
        fit: (create, query) - Apply a viewFit after positioning camera to persp, top, side, or front.
        fitFactor: (create) - Specifies how much of the view should be filled with the "fitted" items
        front: (create) - Moves the camera to the front position.
        home: (create) - Executes the camera's home attribute command. Before the string is executed, all occurances of "%camera" will be replaced by the camera's name. Use the camera command to set a camera's home command.
        keepRenderSettings: (create, query) - Retain the 'renderable' flag vaue on the view. Especially important if it switches from perspective to orthographic and then back again.
        leftSide: (create) - Moves the camera to the left side position.
        namespace: (create) - Specifies a namespace that should be excluded. All objects in the specified namespace will be excluded from the fit process.
        nextView: (create, query) - Moves the camera to the next position.
        persp: (create) - Moves the camera to the persp position.
        previousView: (create, query) - Moves the camera to the previous position.
        rightSide: (create) - Moves the camera to the right side position.
        side: (create) - Moves the camera to the (right) side position (deprecated).
        top: (create) - Moves the camera to the top position.
        viewNegativeX: (create) - Moves the camera to view along negative X axis.
        viewNegativeY: (create) - Moves the camera to view along negative Y axis.
        viewNegativeZ: (create) - Moves the camera to view along negative Z axis.
        viewX: (create) - Moves the camera to view along X axis.
        viewY: (create) - Moves the camera to view along Y axis.
        viewZ: (create) - Moves the camera to view along Z axis.
