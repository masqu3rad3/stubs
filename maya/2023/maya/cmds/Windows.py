        docTag: (create, edit, query) - Add a documentation flag to the control.  The documentation flag has a directory structure. (e.g., -dt render/multiLister/createNode/material)
        dragCallback: (create, edit) - Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:  global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods)  The proc returns a string array that is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type.  Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers CTRL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTRL, 3 == CTRL + SHIFT.  In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form:  def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ):  The values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above.  The other way to specify the callback in Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys "dragControl", "x", "y", "modifiers".  The "dragControl" value is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be "print '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'")
        dropCallback: (create, edit) - Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:  global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int $y, int $type)  The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback. $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link.  In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form:  def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ):  The values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above.  The other way to specify the callback in Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys "dragControl", "dropControl", "messages", "x", "y", "type".  The "dragControl" value is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be "print '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'")
        enable: (create, edit, query) - The enable state of the control.  By default, this flag is set to true and the control is enabled.  Specify false and the control will appear dimmed or greyed-out indicating it is disabled.
        enableBackground: (create, edit, query) - Enables the background color of the control.
        enableKeyboardFocus: (create, edit, query) - If enabled, the user can navigate to the control with the tab key and select values with the keyboard or mouse. This flag would typically be used to turn off focus support from controls that get it by default, like Edit and List controls. If disabled, text in text fields can still be selected with the mouse but cannot be copied (except on Linux when "Middle Click Paste" is enabled).
        exists: (create) - Returns whether the specified object exists or not. Other flags are ignored.
        fullPathName: (query) - Return the full path name of the widget, which includes all the parents.
        height: (create, edit, query) - The height of the control.  The control will attempt to be this size if it is not overruled by parent layout conditions.
        highlightColor: (create, edit, query) - The highlight color of the control. The arguments correspond to the red, green, and blue color components. Each component ranges in value from 0.0 to 1.0.
        hsvValue: (create, edit, query) - Specifies the color in hsv style.
        isObscured: (query) - Return whether the control can actually be seen by the user. The control will be obscured if its state is invisible, if it is blocked (entirely or partially) by some other control, if it or a parent layout is unmanaged, or if the control's window is invisible or iconified.
        label: (create, edit, query) - By default, the label of this field will be the name of the attribute.  This flag can be used to override that name with whatever the user wants.
        manage: (create, edit, query) - Manage state of the control.  An unmanaged control is not visible, nor does it take up any screen real estate.  All controls are created managed by default.
        noBackground: (create, edit) - Clear/reset the control's background. Passing true means the background should not be drawn at all, false means the background should be drawn.  The state of this flag is inherited by children of this control.
        numberOfPopupMenus: (query) - Return the number of popup menus attached to this control.
        parent: (create, query) - The parent layout for this control.
        popupMenuArray: (query) - Return the names of all the popup menus attached to this control.
        preventOverride: (create, edit, query) - If true, this flag prevents overriding the control's attribute via the control's right mouse button menu.
        rgbValue: (create, edit, query) - Specifies the color in rgb style.
        rowAttach: (create, edit, multiuse) - Arguments are : column, attachment type, offset. Possible attachments are: top | bottom | both. Specifies attachment types and offsets for the entire row.
        showButton: (create, edit, query) - Control the display of the texture link button. True by default (show it).
        statusBarMessage: (create, edit) - Extra string to display in the status bar when the mouse is over the control.
        useTemplate: (create) - Forces the command to use a command template other than the current one.
        visible: (create, edit, query) - The visible state of the control.  A control is created visible by default.  Note that a control's actual appearance is also dependent on the visible state of its parent layout(s).
        visibleChangeCommand: (create, edit, query) - Command that gets executed when visible state of the control changes.
        width: (create, edit, query) - The width of the control.  The control will attempt to be this size if it is not overruled by parent layout conditions.

They will be used as default arguments in any subsequent invocations of the command when templateName is set as the current template.
        docTag: (create, edit, query) - Add a documentation flag to the control.  The documentation flag has a directory structure. (e.g., -dt render/multiLister/createNode/material)
        dragCallback: (create, edit) - Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:  global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods)  The proc returns a string array that is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type.  Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers CTRL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTRL, 3 == CTRL + SHIFT.  In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form:  def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ):  The values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above.  The other way to specify the callback in Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys "dragControl", "x", "y", "modifiers".  The "dragControl" value is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be "print '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'")
        dropCallback: (create, edit) - Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:  global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int $y, int $type)  The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback. $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link.  In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form:  def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ):  The values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above.  The other way to specify the callback in Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys "dragControl", "dropControl", "messages", "x", "y", "type".  The "dragControl" value is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be "print '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'")
        enable: (create, edit, query) - The enable state of the control.  By default, this flag is set to true and the control is enabled.  Specify false and the control will appear dimmed or greyed-out indicating it is disabled.
        enableBackground: (create, edit, query) - Enables the background color of the control.
        enableKeyboardFocus: (create, edit, query) - If enabled, the user can navigate to the control with the tab key and select values with the keyboard or mouse. This flag would typically be used to turn off focus support from controls that get it by default, like Edit and List controls. If disabled, text in text fields can still be selected with the mouse but cannot be copied (except on Linux when "Middle Click Paste" is enabled).
        enumeratedItem: (create, multiuse) - Enumerated item and the corresponding string. If this flag is not supplied when the control is created, then the command will try to read the values from the attribute.
        exists: (create) - Returns whether the specified object exists or not. Other flags are ignored.
        fullPathName: (query) - Return the full path name of the widget, which includes all the parents.
        height: (create, edit, query) - The height of the control.  The control will attempt to be this size if it is not overruled by parent layout conditions.
        highlightColor: (create, edit, query) - The highlight color of the control. The arguments correspond to the red, green, and blue color components. Each component ranges in value from 0.0 to 1.0.
        isObscured: (query) - Return whether the control can actually be seen by the user. The control will be obscured if its state is invisible, if it is blocked (entirely or partially) by some other control, if it or a parent layout is unmanaged, or if the control's window is invisible or iconified.
        label: (create, edit, query) - Text for the control.
        manage: (create, edit, query) - Manage state of the control.  An unmanaged control is not visible, nor does it take up any screen real estate.  All controls are created managed by default.
        noBackground: (create, edit) - Clear/reset the control's background. Passing true means the background should not be drawn at all, false means the background should be drawn.  The state of this flag is inherited by children of this control.
        numberOfPopupMenus: (query) - Return the number of popup menus attached to this control.
        parent: (create, query) - The parent layout for this control.
        popupMenuArray: (query) - Return the names of all the popup menus attached to this control.
        preventOverride: (create, edit, query) - If true, this flag prevents overriding the control's attribute via the control's right mouse button menu.
        rowAttach: (create, edit, multiuse) - Arguments are : column, attachment type, offset. Possible attachments are: top | bottom | both. Specifies attachment types and offsets for the entire row.
        statusBarMessage: (create, edit) - Extra string to display in the status bar when the mouse is over the control.
        useTemplate: (create) - Forces the command to use a command template other than the current one.
        visible: (create, edit, query) - The visible state of the control.  A control is created visible by default.  Note that a control's actual appearance is also dependent on the visible state of its parent layout(s).
        visibleChangeCommand: (create, edit, query) - Command that gets executed when visible state of the control changes.
        width: (create, edit, query) - The width of the control.  The control will attempt to be this size if it is not overruled by parent layout conditions.

        columnWidth: (create, edit, multiuse) - Arguments are : column number, column width. Sets the width of the specified column where the first parameter specifies the column (1 based index) and the second parameter specifies the width.
        columnWidth1: (create, edit) - Sets the width of the first column. Ignored if there is not exactly one column.
        columnWidth2: (create, edit) - Sets the column widths of both columns. Ignored if there are not exactly two columns.
        columnWidth3: (create, edit) - Sets the column widths for all 3 columns. Ignored if there are not exactly 3 columns.
        columnWidth4: (create, edit) - Sets the column widths for all 4 columns. Ignored if there are not exactly 4 columns.
        columnWidth5: (create, edit) - Sets the column widths for all 5 columns. Ignored if there are not exactly 5 columns.
        columnWidth6: (create, edit) - Sets the column widths for all 6 columns. Ignored if there are not exactly 6 columns.
        defineTemplate: (create) - Puts the command in a mode where any other flags and arguments are parsed and added to the command template specified in the argument. They will be used as default arguments in any subsequent invocations of the command when templateName is set as the current template.
        docTag: (create, edit, query) - Add a documentation flag to the control.  The documentation flag has a directory structure. (e.g., -dt render/multiLister/createNode/material)
        dragCallback: (create, edit) - Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:  global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods)  The proc returns a string array that is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type.  Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers CTRL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTRL, 3 == CTRL + SHIFT.  In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form:  def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ):  The values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above.  The other way to specify the callback in Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys "dragControl", "x", "y", "modifiers".  The "dragControl" value is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be "print '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'")
        dropCallback: (create, edit) - Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:  global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int $y, int $type)  The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback. $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link.  In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form:  def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ):  The values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above.  The other way to specify the callback in Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys "dragControl", "dropControl", "messages", "x", "y", "type".  The "dragControl" value is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be "print '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'")
        enable: (create, edit, query) - The enable state of the control.  By default, this flag is set to true and the control is enabled.  Specify false and the control will appear dimmed or greyed-out indicating it is disabled.
        enableBackground: (create, edit, query) - Enables the background color of the control.
        enableKeyboardFocus: (create, edit, query) - If enabled, the user can navigate to the control with the tab key and select values with the keyboard or mouse. This flag would typically be used to turn off focus support from controls that get it by default, like Edit and List controls. If disabled, text in text fields can still be selected with the mouse but cannot be copied (except on Linux when "Middle Click Paste" is enabled).
        exists: (create) - Returns whether the specified object exists or not. Other flags are ignored.
        extraButton: (create) - Add an extra icon button to the end of this control (before extra label).
        extraButtonCommand: (create, edit) - The command string is executed when the extra button is clicked.
        extraButtonIcon: (create, edit, query) - The icon file name of the extra button.
        extraLabel: (create, edit, query) - set an optional string that will be positioned to the right of all the fields.
        forceAddMapButton: (create) - Force adding a map button to this control. If this option is true, option hideMapButton is suppressed.
        fullPathName: (query) - Return the full path name of the widget, which includes all the parents.
        height: (create, edit, query) - The height of the control.  The control will attempt to be this size if it is not overruled by parent layout conditions.
        hideMapButton: (create) - Force the map button to remain hidden for this control.
        highlightColor: (create, edit, query) - The highlight color of the control. The arguments correspond to the red, green, and blue color components. Each component ranges in value from 0.0 to 1.0.
        isObscured: (query) - Return whether the control can actually be seen by the user. The control will be obscured if its state is invisible, if it is blocked (entirely or partially) by some other control, if it or a parent layout is unmanaged, or if the control's window is invisible or iconified.
        label: (create, edit, query) - By default, the label of this field will be the name of the attribute.  This flag can be used to override that name with whatever the user wants.
        manage: (create, edit, query) - Manage state of the control.  An unmanaged control is not visible, nor does it take up any screen real estate.  All controls are created managed by default.
        maxValue: (create, edit, query) - Sets the maximum value for all fields.
        minValue: (create, edit, query) - Sets the minimum value for all fields.
        noBackground: (create, edit) - Clear/reset the control's background. Passing true means the background should not be drawn at all, false means the background should be drawn.  The state of this flag is inherited by children of this control.
        numberOfFields: (create) - sets the number of fields.  Only allowed values are 2 to 4.  If not specified, defaults to 3.  NOTE: if the -at flag is used when this widget is created, the number of children in the attribute will determine the number of fields.  Also note:  after creation, the number of fields cannot be changed with the -e flag.
        numberOfPopupMenus: (query) - Return the number of popup menus attached to this control.
        parent: (create, query) - The parent layout for this control.
        popupMenuArray: (query) - Return the names of all the popup menus attached to this control.
        precision: (create, edit) - Sets the precision for all fields
        preventOverride: (create, edit, query) - If true, this flag prevents overriding the control's attribute via the control's right mouse button menu.
        rowAttach: (create, edit, multiuse) - Arguments are : column, attachment type, offset. Possible attachments are: top | bottom | both. Specifies attachment types and offsets for the entire row.
        statusBarMessage: (create, edit) - Extra string to display in the status bar when the mouse is over the control.
        step: (create, edit, query) - Sets the increment for all fields
        useTemplate: (create) - Forces the command to use a command template other than the current one.
        visible: (create, edit, query) - The visible state of the control.  A control is created visible by default.  Note that a control's actual appearance is also dependent on the visible state of its parent layout(s).
        visibleChangeCommand: (create, edit, query) - Command that gets executed when visible state of the control changes.
        width: (create, edit, query) - The width of the control.  The control will attempt to be this size if it is not overruled by parent layout conditions.

If the callback returns one then the menu is considered built and no other menuItems will be added to the popup. The return value from this flag will be the ID to use for the -unregPulldownMenuCommand flag.

        createNew: (create, edit, query) - The script to execute when a new "connection" is requested.
        defaultTraversal: (create, edit, query) - The script to execute to find out the name of the default traversal node.  The script you attach should be able to take in one argument (the attribute) and return the name of the node that is the default traversal node.
        defineTemplate: (create) - Puts the command in a mode where any other flags and arguments are parsed and added to the command template specified in the argument. They will be used as default arguments in any subsequent invocations of the command when templateName is set as the current template.

        disconnect: (create, edit, query) - The script to execute when a "disconnection" is requested.
        docTag: (create, edit, query) - Add a documentation flag to the control.  The documentation flag has a directory structure. (e.g., -dt render/multiLister/createNode/material)
        dragCallback: (create, edit) - Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:  global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods)  The proc returns a string array that is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type.  Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers CTRL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTRL, 3 == CTRL + SHIFT.  In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form:  def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ):  The values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above.  The other way to specify the callback in Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys "dragControl", "x", "y", "modifiers".  The "dragControl" value is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be "print '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'")
        dropCallback: (create, edit) - Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:  global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int $y, int $type)  The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback. $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link.  In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form:  def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ):  The values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above.  The other way to specify the callback in Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys "dragControl", "dropControl", "messages", "x", "y", "type".  The "dragControl" value is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be "print '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'")
        enable: (create, edit, query) - The enable state of the control.  By default, this flag is set to true and the control is enabled.  Specify false and the control will appear dimmed or greyed-out indicating it is disabled.
        enableBackground: (create, edit, query) - Enables the background color of the control.
        enableKeyboardFocus: (create, edit, query) - If enabled, the user can navigate to the control with the tab key and select values with the keyboard or mouse. This flag would typically be used to turn off focus support from controls that get it by default, like Edit and List controls. If disabled, text in text fields can still be selected with the mouse but cannot be copied (except on Linux when "Middle Click Paste" is enabled).
        exists: (create) - Returns whether the specified object exists or not. Other flags are ignored.
        extraButton: (create) - Add an extra icon button to the last of this control.
        extraButtonCommand: (create, edit) - The command string is executed when the extra button is clicked.
        extraButtonIcon: (create, edit, query) - The icon file name of the extra button.
        fullPathName: (query) - Return the full path name of the widget, which includes all the parents.
        height: (create, edit, query) - The height of the control.  The control will attempt to be this size if it is not overruled by parent layout conditions.
        highlightColor: (create, edit, query) - The highlight color of the control. The arguments correspond to the red, green, and blue color components. Each component ranges in value from 0.0 to 1.0.
        ignore: (create, edit, query) - The script to execute when the connection should be ignored.
        ignoreNotSupported: () - Obsolete flag; has no effect.
        isObscured: (query) - Return whether the control can actually be seen by the user. The control will be obscured if its state is invisible, if it is blocked (entirely or partially) by some other control, if it or a parent layout is unmanaged, or if the control's window is invisible or iconified.
        label: (create, edit, query) - Text for the control.
        manage: (create, edit, query) - Manage state of the control.  An unmanaged control is not visible, nor does it take up any screen real estate.  All controls are created managed by default.
        noBackground: (create, edit) - Clear/reset the control's background. Passing true means the background should not be drawn at all, false means the background should be drawn.  The state of this flag is inherited by children of this control.
        noIgnorableMenu: (create, edit) - Not show ignorable related popup menu when right click the label.
        noKeyableMenu: (create, edit) - Not show keyable related popup menu when right click the label.
        numberOfPopupMenus: (query) - Return the number of popup menus attached to this control.
        parent: (create, query) - The parent layout for this control.
        popupMenuArray: (query) - Return the names of all the popup menus attached to this control.
        preventOverride: (create, edit, query) - If true, this flag prevents overriding the control's attribute via the control's right mouse button menu.
        relatedNodes: (create, edit, query) - The script to execute to find out what the related nodes are.  The script you attach should be able to take in one argument (the attribute) and return a list of strings that are the name of the nodes that are related.
        rowAttach: (create, edit, multiuse) - Arguments are : column, attachment type, offset. Possible attachments are: top | bottom | both. Specifies attachment types and offsets for the entire row.
        statusBarMessage: (create, edit) - Extra string to display in the status bar when the mouse is over the control.
        unignore: (create, edit, query) - The script to execute when the connection should be unignored.
        useTemplate: (create) - Forces the command to use a command template other than the current one.
        visible: (create, edit, query) - The visible state of the control.  A control is created visible by default.  Note that a control's actual appearance is also dependent on the visible state of its parent layout(s).
        visibleChangeCommand: (create, edit, query) - Command that gets executed when visible state of the control changes.
        width: (create, edit, query) - The width of the control.  The control will attempt to be this size if it is not overruled by parent layout conditions.

        enable: (create, edit, query) - The enable state of the control.  By default, this flag is set to true and the control is enabled.  Specify false and the control will appear dimmed or greyed-out indicating it is disabled.
        enableBackground: (create, edit, query) - Enables the background color of the control.
        enableKeyboardFocus: (create, edit, query) - If enabled, the user can navigate to the control with the tab key and select values with the keyboard or mouse. This flag would typically be used to turn off focus support from controls that get it by default, like Edit and List controls. If disabled, text in text fields can still be selected with the mouse but cannot be copied (except on Linux when "Middle Click Paste" is enabled).
        exists: (create) - Returns whether the specified object exists or not. Other flags are ignored.
        fullPathName: (query) - Return the full path name of the widget, which includes all the parents.

        highlightColor: (create, edit, query) - The highlight color of the control. The arguments correspond to the red, green, and blue color components. Each component ranges in value from 0.0 to 1.0.
        isObscured: (query) - Return whether the control can actually be seen by the user. The control will be obscured if its state is invisible, if it is blocked (entirely or partially) by some other control, if it or a parent layout is unmanaged, or if the control's window is invisible or iconified.
        label: (create, edit, query) - The label text.  The default label is the name of the control.
        manage: (create, edit, query) - Manage state of the control.  An unmanaged control is not visible, nor does it take up any screen real estate.  All controls are created managed by default.
        noBackground: (create, edit) - Clear/reset the control's background. Passing true means the background should not be drawn at all, false means the background should be drawn.  The state of this flag is inherited by children of this control.
        numberOfPopupMenus: (query) - Return the number of popup menus attached to this control.
        parent: (create, query) - The parent layout for this control.
        popupMenuArray: (query) - Return the names of all the popup menus attached to this control.
        preventOverride: (create, edit, query) - If true, this flag prevents overriding the control's attribute via the control's right mouse button menu.
        recomputeSize: (create, edit, query) - If true then the control will recompute it's size to just fit the size of the label.  If false then the control size will remain fixed as you change the size of the label.  The default value of this flag is true.
        statusBarMessage: (create, edit) - Extra string to display in the status bar when the mouse is over the control.
        useTemplate: (create) - Forces the command to use a command template other than the current one.
        visible: (create, edit, query) - The visible state of the control.  A control is created visible by default.  Note that a control's actual appearance is also dependent on the visible state of its parent layout(s).
        visibleChangeCommand: (create, edit, query) - Command that gets executed when visible state of the control changes.
        width: (create, edit, query) - The width of the control.  The control will attempt to be this size if it is not overruled by parent layout conditions.

    Creates a control capable of displaying a color swatch. This control can also accept a command to be called when the colour swatch is pressed by the user.

    Args:
        annotation: (create, edit, query) - Annotate the control with an extra string value.
        backgroundColor: (create, edit, query) - The background color of the control. The arguments correspond to the red, green, and blue color components. Each component ranges in value from 0.0 to 1.0. When setting backgroundColor, the background is automatically enabled, unless enableBackground is also specified with a false value.
        defineTemplate: (create) - Puts the command in a mode where any other flags and arguments are parsed and added to the command template specified in the argument. They will be used as default arguments in any subsequent invocations of the command when templateName is set as the current template.
        docTag: (create, edit, query) - Add a documentation flag to the control.  The documentation flag has a directory structure. (e.g., -dt render/multiLister/createNode/material)
        dragCallback: (create, edit) - Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:  global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods)  The proc returns a string array that is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type.  Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers CTRL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTRL, 3 == CTRL + SHIFT.  In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form:  def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ):  The values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above.  The other way to specify the callback in Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys "dragControl", "x", "y", "modifiers".  The "dragControl" value is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be "print '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'")
        dropCallback: (create, edit) - Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:  global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int $y, int $type)  The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback. $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link.  In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form:  def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ):  The values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above.  The other way to specify the callback in Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys "dragControl", "dropControl", "messages", "x", "y", "type".  The "dragControl" value is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be "print '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'")
        enable: (create, edit, query) - The enable state of the control.  By default, this flag is set to true and the control is enabled.  Specify false and the control will appear dimmed or greyed-out indicating it is disabled.
        enableBackground: (create, edit, query) - Enables the background color of the control.
        enableKeyboardFocus: (create, edit, query) - If enabled, the user can navigate to the control with the tab key and select values with the keyboard or mouse. This flag would typically be used to turn off focus support from controls that get it by default, like Edit and List controls. If disabled, text in text fields can still be selected with the mouse but cannot be copied (except on Linux when "Middle Click Paste" is enabled).
        exists: (create) - Returns whether the specified object exists or not. Other flags are ignored.
        fullPathName: (query) - Return the full path name of the widget, which includes all the parents.
        height: (create, edit, query) - The height of the control.  The control will attempt to be this size if it is not overruled by parent layout conditions.
        highlightColor: (create, edit, query) - The highlight color of the control. The arguments correspond to the red, green, and blue color components. Each component ranges in value from 0.0 to 1.0.
        hsvValue: (create, edit, query) - Three float values corresponding to the hue, saturation, and value color components, where the hue value ranges from 0.0 to 360.0 and the saturation and value components range from 0.0 to 1.0.
        isObscured: (query) - Return whether the control can actually be seen by the user. The control will be obscured if its state is invisible, if it is blocked (entirely or partially) by some other control, if it or a parent layout is unmanaged, or if the control's window is invisible or iconified.
        manage: (create, edit, query) - Manage state of the control.  An unmanaged control is not visible, nor does it take up any screen real estate.  All controls are created managed by default.
        noBackground: (create, edit) - Clear/reset the control's background. Passing true means the background should not be drawn at all, false means the background should be drawn.  The state of this flag is inherited by children of this control.
        numberOfPopupMenus: (query) - Return the number of popup menus attached to this control.
        parent: (create, query) - The parent layout for this control.
        popupMenuArray: (query) - Return the names of all the popup menus attached to this control.
        pressCommand: (create, edit) - Command to be executed when there is a mouse press.
        preventOverride: (create, edit, query) - If true, this flag prevents overriding the control's attribute via the control's right mouse button menu.

    This command creates a channel box, which is sensitive to the active list.  It displays certain attributes (channels) of the last node on the active list, and provides a two-way connection to keep the widget up to date.

    Args:
        annotation: (create, edit, query) - Annotate the control with an extra string value.
        attrBgColor: (create, edit, query) - Controls the background text color of specific attribute names. As with the foreground option, this text coloring also depends on the node name choice for the nodeRegex flag. Arguments correspond to the red, green, and blue color components. Each component ranges in value from 0.0 to 1.0. If attrRegex is unspecified then it will assume a value of "*" for a regular expression. The same idea simultaneously applies to the flag nodeRegex. Note: nodes that are renamed will have their node name coloring be affected in the channel box.
        attrColor: (create, edit, query) - Controls the foreground text color of specific attribute names. This text coloring also depends on the node name choice for the nodeRegex flag. Arguments correspond to the red, green, and blue color components. Each component ranges in value from 0.0 to 1.0. If attrRegex is unspecified then it will assume a value of "*" for a regular expression. The same idea simultaneously applies to the flag nodeRegex. Note: nodes that are renamed will have their node name coloring be affected in the channel box.
        attrFilter: (edit, query) - Specifies the name of an itemFilter object to be placed on the channel box. This filters the attributes displayed. A filter of "0" can be used to reset the filter.
        attrRegex: (create, edit, query) - Specifies a valid regular expression to specify which attribute names should be selected for foreground text coloring. If attrRegex is unspecified then it will assume a value of "*" for a regular expression. The same idea simultaneously applies to the flag nodeRegex. The attrColor flag is required to be specified. Note: this regular expression will be treated as though it were case-insensitve
        attributeEditorMode: (edit, query) - Modifies what appears in the channel box for use in the attribute editor. Default is false. Queried, returns a boolean.
        backgroundColor: (create, edit, query) - The background color of the control. The arguments correspond to the red, green, and blue color components. Each component ranges in value from 0.0 to 1.0. When setting backgroundColor, the background is automatically enabled, unless enableBackground is also specified with a false value.
        containerAtTop: (edit, query) - This flag can be used to specify whether or not the container is drawn at the top of the channel box when a node in the container is selected.
        defineTemplate: (create) - Puts the command in a mode where any other flags and arguments are parsed and added to the command template specified in the argument. They will be used as default arguments in any subsequent invocations of the command when templateName is set as the current template.
        docTag: (create, edit, query) - Add a documentation flag to the control.  The documentation flag has a directory structure. (e.g., -dt render/multiLister/createNode/material)
        dragCallback: (create, edit) - Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:  global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods)  The proc returns a string array that is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type.  Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers CTRL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTRL, 3 == CTRL + SHIFT.  In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form:  def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ):  The values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above.  The other way to specify the callback in Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys "dragControl", "x", "y", "modifiers".  The "dragControl" value is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be "print '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'")
        dropCallback: (create, edit) - Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:  global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int $y, int $type)  The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback. $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link.  In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form:  def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ):  The values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above.  The other way to specify the callback in Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys "dragControl", "dropControl", "messages", "x", "y", "type".  The "dragControl" value is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be "print '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'")
        enable: (create, edit, query) - The enable state of the control.  By default, this flag is set to true and the control is enabled.  Specify false and the control will appear dimmed or greyed-out indicating it is disabled.
        enableBackground: (create, edit, query) - Enables the background color of the control.
        enableKeyboardFocus: (create, edit, query) - If enabled, the user can navigate to the control with the tab key and select values with the keyboard or mouse. This flag would typically be used to turn off focus support from controls that get it by default, like Edit and List controls. If disabled, text in text fields can still be selected with the mouse but cannot be copied (except on Linux when "Middle Click Paste" is enabled).
        enableLabelSelection: (edit, query) - Enables the selection of attributes in the channelBox when used in conjunction with -attributeEditorMode. Default is false.  Queried, returns a boolean.
        execute: (edit) - Immediately executes the command string once for every cell (or every selected cell, if the boolean argument is TRUE) in the channel box, for every matching selected object (ie, for every object would be affected if you changed a cell value.)  Before the command is executed, "#A" is substituted with the name of the attribute, and "#N" with the name of the node, and "#P" with the full path name of the node.
        exists: (create) - Returns whether the specified object exists or not. Other flags are ignored.
        fieldWidth: (edit, query) - An optional flag which is used to modify the width assigned to fields appearing in the channelBox.
        fixedAttrList: (create, edit, query) - Forces the channel box to only display attributes with the specified names, in the order they are specified.  If an empty list is specified, then the channel box will revert to its default behaviour of listing all keyable attributes.
        fullPathName: (query) - Return the full path name of the widget, which includes all the parents.
        height: (create, edit, query) - The height of the control.  The control will attempt to be this size if it is not overruled by parent layout conditions.
        highlightColor: (create, edit, query) - The highlight color of the control. The arguments correspond to the red, green, and blue color components. Each component ranges in value from 0.0 to 1.0.
        historyObjectList: (query) - Returns a list of strings, the names of every INPUT node associated with an object on the main object list that is of the same type as the node displayed in the INPUT section of the channel box.
        hyperbolic: (create, edit, query) - Determines whether or not the distance that the mouse has been dragged should be interpreted as a linear or hyperbolic function.  The default is set to hyperbolic being false.
        inputs: (query) - Returns the items shown under the 'INPUTS' heading in the channel box.
        isObscured: (query) - Return whether the control can actually be seen by the user. The control will be obscured if its state is invisible, if it is blocked (entirely or partially) by some other control, if it or a parent layout is unmanaged, or if the control's window is invisible or iconified.
        labelWidth: (edit, query) - An optional flag which is used to modify the width assigned to labels appearing in the channelBox.
        longNames: (edit, query) - Controls whether long or short attribute names will be used in the interface.  Note that this flag is ignored if the -niceNames flag is set.  Default is short names. Queried, returns a boolean.
        mainListConnection: (create, edit, query) - Specifies the name of a selectionConnection object which the editor will use as its source of content.  The channel box will only display the (last) item contained in the selectionConnection object. If a NULL string ("") is specified, then the channel box will revert to its default behaviour of working on the active list.
        mainObjectList: (query) - Returns a list of strings, the names of every object on the active list that is the same type as the object displayed in the top (main) section of the channel box.
        manage: (create, edit, query) - Manage state of the control.  An unmanaged control is not visible, nor does it take up any screen real estate.  All controls are created managed by default.
        maxHeight: (edit, query) - An optional flag which is used to limit the height of the channelBox.
        maxWidth: (edit, query) - An optional flag which is used to limit the width of the channelBox.
        niceNames: (edit, query) - Controls whether the attribute names will be displayed in a more user-friendly, readable way.  When this is on, the longNames flag is ignored.  When this is off, attribute names will be displayed either long or short, according to the longNames flag. Default is on. Queried, returns a boolean.
        noBackground: (create, edit) - Clear/reset the control's background. Passing true means the background should not be drawn at all, false means the background should be drawn.  The state of this flag is inherited by children of this control.
        nodeRegex: (create, edit, query) - Specifies a valid regular expression to specify which node names should (potentially) have their attributes selected for foreground text coloring. If nodeRegex is unspecified then it will assume a value of "*' for a regular expression. The same idea simultaneously applies to the flag attrRegex. The attrColor flag is required to be specified. Note: this regular expression will be treated as though it were case-insensitve Note: nodes in namespaces have regular expressions applied as though those nodes weren't in namespaces
        numberOfPopupMenus: (query) - Return the number of popup menus attached to this control.
        outputObjectList: (query) - Returns a list of strings, the names of every OUTPUT node associated an object on the main object list that is of the same type as the node displayed in the OUTPUT section of the channel box.
        outputs: (query) - Returns the items shown under the 'OUTPUTS' heading in the channel box.
        parent: (create, query) - The parent layout for this control.
        popupMenuArray: (query) - Return the names of all the popup menus attached to this control.
        precision: (edit, query) - Controls the number of digits to the right of the decimal point that will be displayed for float-valued channels. Default is 3.  Queried, returns an int.
        preventOverride: (create, edit, query) - If true, this flag prevents overriding the control's attribute via the control's right mouse button menu.
        rebuildCommand: (create, edit, query) - Command that gets executed when the channel box is rebuilt, e.g. when a new object is selected.
        select: (edit, multiuse) - Allows programmatic selection of items (nodes or plugs) in the channel box. Selection is equivalent to clicking the item with the mouse; therefore only items currently shown in the channel box can be selected this way.
        selectedHistoryAttributes: (query) - Returns a list of strings, the names of all the selected attributes in the INPUT section of the channel box.
        selectedMainAttributes: (query) - Returns a list of strings, the names of all the selected attributes in the top section of the channel box.
        selectedOutputAttributes: (query) - Returns a list of strings, the names of all the selected attributes in the OUTPUT section of the channel box.
        selectedShapeAttributes: (query) - Returns a list of strings, the names of all the selected attributes in the middle (shape) section of the channel box.
        shapeObjectList: (query) - Returns a list of strings, the names of every shape associated with an object on the main object list that is of the same type as the object displayed in the middle (shape) section of the channel box.
        shapes: (query) - Returns the items shown under the 'SHAPES' heading in the channel box.
        showNamespace: (create, edit, query) - Controls whether or not the namespace of an object is displayed if the object is not in the root namespace.
        showTransforms: (edit, query) - Controls whether this control will display transform attributes only, or all other attributes. False by default. Queried, returns a boolean.
        speed: (create, edit, query) - Controls the speed at which the attributes are changed based on the distance the mouse has been dragged.  Common settings for slow/medium/fast are 0.1/1.0/10.0 respectively.  The default is 1.0.
        statusBarMessage: (create, edit) - Extra string to display in the status bar when the mouse is over the control.
        takeFocus: (edit) - causes the channel box to take over the keyboard focus, if it can.
        ufeFixedAttrList: (create, edit, query) - Forces the channel box to only display attributes for the given UFE runtime with the specified names, in the order they are specified. The attribute list accepts wildcard ('?' for one char, '*' for many) and will use pattern matching for finding attributes to display. If an empty list is specified, then the channel box will display no attributes for the given UFE runtime (since there is no keyable attribute concept in UFE).       In query mode, this flag can accept a value.
        update: (edit) - This flag can be used to force an update of the channel box display, for example after changing a display preference.
        useManips: (create, edit, query) - When you click on a field or label in the channel box, the tool switches to a manipulator that can change that value if you drag in the 3d view.  This flag controls the kind of manips.  Allowed values are "none" (self-explanatory), "invisible" (you won't see anything, but dragging in the window will adjust any of the selected attributes), and "standard" (the same as invisible, except for scale, rotate, and translate, which will be represented by their usual manips.)
        useTemplate: (create) - Forces the command to use a command template other than the current one.
        visible: (create, edit, query) - The visible state of the control.  A control is created visible by default.  Note that a control's actual appearance is also dependent on the visible state of its parent layout(s).
        visibleChangeCommand: (create, edit, query) - Command that gets executed when visible state of the control changes.
        width: (create, edit, query) - The width of the control.  The control will attempt to be this size if it is not overruled by parent layout conditions.

    This command creates a check box.  A check box is a simple control containing a text label and a state of either on or off.  Commands can be attached to any or all of the following events:  when the check box is turned on, turned off, or simply when it's state is changed.

    Args:
        align: (create, edit, query) - This flag is obsolete and should no longer be used. The check box label will always be left-aligned.
        annotation: (create, edit, query) - Annotate the control with an extra string value.
        backgroundColor: (create, edit, query) - The background color of the control. The arguments correspond to the red, green, and blue color components. Each component ranges in value from 0.0 to 1.0. When setting backgroundColor, the background is automatically enabled, unless enableBackground is also specified with a false value.
        changeCommand: (create, edit, query) - Command executed when the check box's state is changed. Note that this flag should not be used in conjunction with onCommand and offCommand. That is, one should either use changeCommand and test the state of the check box from inside the callback, or use onCommand and offCommand as separate callbacks.
        defineTemplate: (create) - Puts the command in a mode where any other flags and arguments are parsed and added to the command template specified in the argument. They will be used as default arguments in any subsequent invocations of the command when templateName is set as the current template.

        editable: (create, edit, query) - The edit state of the check box.  By default, this flag is set to true and the check box value may be changed by clicking on it.  If false then the check box is 'read only' and can not be clicked on. The value of the check box can always be changed with the -v/value flag regardless of the state of the -ed/editable flag.
        enable: (create, edit, query) - The enable state of the control.  By default, this flag is set to true and the control is enabled.  Specify false and the control will appear dimmed or greyed-out indicating it is disabled.

        columnOffset2: (create, edit) - This flag is used in conjunction with the -columnAttach2 flag.  If that flag is not used then this flag will be ignored.  It sets the offset for the two columns.  The offsets applied are based on the attachments specified with the -columnAttach2 flag.  Ignored if there are not exactly two columns.
        columnOffset3: (create, edit) - This flag is used in conjunction with the -columnAttach3 flag.  If that flag is not used then this flag will be ignored.  It sets the offset for the three columns.  The offsets applied are based on the attachments specified with the -columnAttach3 flag.  Ignored if there are not exactly three columns.
        columnOffset4: (create, edit) - This flag is used in conjunction with the -columnAttach4 flag.  If that flag is not used then this flag will be ignored.

        defineTemplate: (create) - Puts the command in a mode where any other flags and arguments are parsed and added to the command template specified in the argument. They will be used as default arguments in any subsequent invocations of the command when templateName is set as the current template.
        docTag: (create, edit, query) - Add a documentation flag to the control.  The documentation flag has a directory structure. (e.g., -dt render/multiLister/createNode/material)
        dragCallback: (create, edit) - Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:  global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods)  The proc returns a string array that is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type.  Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers CTRL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTRL, 3 == CTRL + SHIFT.  In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form:  def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ):  The values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above.  The other way to specify the callback in Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys "dragControl", "x", "y", "modifiers".  The "dragControl" value is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be "print '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'")
        dropCallback: (create, edit) - Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:  global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int $y, int $type)  The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback. $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link.  In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form:  def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ):  The values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above.  The other way to specify the callback in Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys "dragControl", "dropControl", "messages", "x", "y", "type".  The "dragControl" value is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be "print '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'")
        editable: (create, edit, query) - The edit state of the group.  By default, this flag is set to true and the check box values may be changed by clicking on them.  If false then the check boxes are 'read only' and can not be clicked on. The value of the check boxes can always be changed with the -v/value flags regardless of the state of the -ed/editable flag.
        enable: (create, edit, query) - The enable state of the control.  By default, this flag is set to true and the control is enabled.  Specify false and the control will appear dimmed or greyed-out indicating it is disabled.
        enable1: (create, edit, query) - 
        enable2: (create, edit, query) - 
        enable3: (create, edit, query) - 
        enable4: (create, edit, query) - Enable state of the individual check boxes.
        enableBackground: (create, edit, query) - Enables the background color of the control.
        enableKeyboardFocus: (create, edit, query) - If enabled, the user can navigate to the control with the tab key and select values with the keyboard or mouse. This flag would typically be used to turn off focus support from controls that get it by default, like Edit and List controls. If disabled, text in text fields can still be selected with the mouse but cannot be copied (except on Linux when "Middle Click Paste" is enabled).
        exists: (create) - Returns whether the specified object exists or not. Other flags are ignored.
        fullPathName: (query) - Return the full path name of the widget, which includes all the parents.
        height: (create, edit, query) - The height of the control.  The control will attempt to be this size if it is not overruled by parent layout conditions.
        highlightColor: (create, edit, query) - The highlight color of the control. The arguments correspond to the red, green, and blue color components. Each component ranges in value from 0.0 to 1.0.
        isObscured: (query) - Return whether the control can actually be seen by the user. The control will be obscured if its state is invisible, if it is blocked (entirely or partially) by some other control, if it or a parent layout is unmanaged, or if the control's window is invisible or iconified.
        label: (create, edit, query) - When present on creation an optional text label will be built with the group.  The string specifes the label text.
        label1: (create, edit, query) - 
        label2: (create, edit, query) - 
        label3: (create, edit, query) - 
        label4: (create, edit, query) - Specify label strings for the respective check boxes in the group.
        labelArray2: (create, edit, query) - 
        labelArray3: (create, edit, query) - 
        labelArray4: (create, edit, query) - Specify multiple labels in a single flag.  These flags are ignored if the number of radio buttons doesn't match.
        manage: (create, edit, query) - Manage state of the control.  An unmanaged control is not visible, nor does it take up any screen real estate.  All controls are created managed by default.
        noBackground: (create, edit) - Clear/reset the control's background. Passing true means the background should not be drawn at all, false means the background should be drawn.  The state of this flag is inherited by children of this control.
        numberOfCheckBoxes: (create) - Number of check boxes in the group (1 - 4).
        numberOfPopupMenus: (query) - Return the number of popup menus attached to this control.
        offCommand: (create, edit) - Command executed when any check box turns off.
        offCommand1: (create, edit) - 
        offCommand2: (create, edit) - 
        offCommand3: (create, edit) - 
        offCommand4: (create, edit) - Off command for each respective check box.
        onCommand: (create, edit) - Command executed when any check box turns on.
        onCommand1: (create, edit) - 
        onCommand2: (create, edit) - 
        onCommand3: (create, edit) - 
        onCommand4: (create, edit) - On command for each respective check box.
        parent: (create, query) - The parent layout for this control.
        popupMenuArray: (query) - Return the names of all the popup menus attached to this control.
        preventOverride: (create, edit, query) - If true, this flag prevents overriding the control's attribute via the control's right mouse button menu.
        rowAttach: (create, edit, multiuse) - Arguments are : column, attachment type, offset. Possible attachments are: top | bottom | both. Specifies attachment types and offsets for the entire row.
        statusBarMessage: (create, edit) - Extra string to display in the status bar when the mouse is over the control.
        useTemplate: (create) - Forces the command to use a command template other than the current one.
        value1: (create, edit, query) - 
        value2: (create, edit, query) - 
        value3: (create, edit, query) - 
        value4: (create, edit, query) - Values for the respective check boxes in the group.
        valueArray2: (create, edit, query) - 
        valueArray3: (create, edit, query) - 
        valueArray4: (create, edit, query) - Specifies multiple values in a single flag.  These flags are ignored if the number of check boxes doesn't match.
        vertical: (create, query) - Whether the orientation of the checkbox controls in this group are horizontal (default) or vertical.
        visible: (create, edit, query) - The visible state of the control.  A control is created visible by default.  Note that a control's actual appearance is also dependent on the visible state of its parent layout(s).
        visibleChangeCommand: (create, edit, query) - Command that gets executed when visible state of the control changes.
        width: (create, edit, query) - The width of the control.  The control will attempt to be this size if it is not overruled by parent layout conditions.

The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys "dragControl", "dropControl", "messages", "x", "y", "type".  The "dragControl" value is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be "print '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'")
        enable: (create, edit, query) - The enable state of the control.  By default, this flag is set to true and the control is enabled.  Specify false and the control will appear dimmed or greyed-out indicating it is disabled.
        enableBackground: (create, edit, query) - Enables the background color of the control.
        enableKeyboardFocus: (create, edit, query) - If enabled, the user can navigate to the control with the tab key and select values with the keyboard or mouse. This flag would typically be used to turn off focus support from controls that get it by default, like Edit and List controls. If disabled, text in text fields can still be selected with the mouse but cannot be copied (except on Linux when "Middle Click Paste" is enabled).
        execute: (create, edit) - Executes the current selection.  If there is no selection, all text is executed.
        executeAll: (create, edit) - Executes all text.
        exists: (create) - Returns whether the specified object exists or not. Other flags are ignored.
        fileChangedCommand: (create, edit) - Only valid when this field contains a file. Sets a script which will be called whenever the file is externally modified, renamed or removed from disk. In MEL, the function should have the following signature:  proc fileChanged(string $file)
        filename: (query) - Returns the full path + filename of the script which was either loaded or saved. If there isn't one returns an empty string.
        filterKeyPress: (create, edit, query) - Sets a script which will be called to handle key-press events. The function should have the following signature:  proc int filterKeyPress(int $modifiers, string $key)  modifiers: a bit mask where Shift is bit 1, Ctrl is bit 3, Alt is bit 4, and bit 5 is the 'Windows' key on Windows keyboards and the Command key on Mac keyboards.  key: Specifies what key was pressed. The key is either a single ascii character or one of the keyword strings for the special keyboard characters. For example: Up, Down, Right, Left, Home, End, Page_Up, Page_Down, Insert Return, Space F1 to F12  The function should return 1 to indicate that they key event has been handled, and 0 to indicate that it has not been handled.
        fullPathName: (query) - Return the full path name of the widget, which includes all the parents.
        hasFocus: (query) - Whether this control is currently in focus.
        hasSelection: (query) - Whether this control currently has a selection or not.
        height: (create, edit, query) - The height of the control.  The control will attempt to be this size if it is not overruled by parent layout conditions.
        highlightColor: (create, edit, query) - The highlight color of the control. The arguments correspond to the red, green, and blue color components. Each component ranges in value from 0.0 to 1.0.
        insertText: (create, edit) - Inserts the specified text into the position under the cursor, replacing any currently selected text. The selection and cursor position can be set using the select flag. Appends text to the end of this field.
        isObscured: (query) - Return whether the control can actually be seen by the user. The control will be obscured if its state is invisible, if it is blocked (entirely or partially) by some other control, if it or a parent layout is unmanaged, or if the control's window is invisible or iconified.
        load: (create, edit) - Prompts the user for a script to load into this field.  The loaded filename becomes associated with this executer field and saving will save directly to the file.
        loadContents: (create, edit) - Loads the contents of the specified filename into this field.  The path and extension for this filename is provided internally.  This command is only intended for loading the contents of this executer field from a previous instance of this executer field.
        loadFile: (create, edit) - If the provided string is a fully specified file path, then attempts to load the file contents into this field.  If the string is empty or not valid then prompts the user for a script to load into this field.  In both cases the filename becomes associated with this executer field and saving will save directly to the file.
        manage: (create, edit, query) - Manage state of the control.  An unmanaged control is not visible, nor does it take up any screen real estate.  All controls are created managed by default.
        modificationChangedCommand: (create, edit) - Sets a script which will be called whenever the content of this field changes in a way that affects the modification state. In MEL, the function should have the following signature:  proc modificationChanged(int $m)  If $m is true, the field has been modified; otherwise it is false.
        modified: (edit, query) - Sets or returns whether the field has been modified.
        noBackground: (create, edit) - Clear/reset the control's background. Passing true means the background should not be drawn at all, false means the background should be drawn.  The state of this flag is inherited by children of this control.
        numberOfLines: (query) - Returns the total number of lines in the document.
        numberOfPopupMenus: (query) - Return the number of popup menus attached to this control.
        objectPathCompletion: (create, edit, query) - Enable/disable path completion

        preventOverride: (create, edit, query) - If true, this flag prevents overriding the control's attribute via the control's right mouse button menu.
        redo: (create, edit) - Redo the last operation.
        removeStoredContents: (create, edit) - Removes the stored contents of this field with the specified filename.  The path and extension for the file is provided internally.  This command is only intended for removing previously stored contents of this executer field.
        replaceAll: (create, edit) - Replaces all instances of the first string in the field text with the second string.  The case sensitivity of this operation is set with the -searchMatchCase flag.
        saveFile: (create, edit) - Saves the entire script contents of this field directly to the specified file path.
        saveSelection: (create, edit) - Prompts to save the current selection to a file.  The default filename prompt will be prepended with the given string.

        showTabsAndSpaces: (create, edit, query) - Visually show tab and space indicators. (default off)
        showTooltipHelp: (create, edit, query) - Enable/disable tooltips in the command execution window
        source: (create, edit) - Prompts the user for a script to source (execute without loading).
        sourceType: (create, query) - Sets the source type for this command executer field. Valid values are "mel" (enabled by default) and "python".
        spacesPerTab: (create, edit, query) - Specifies the number of spaces equivalent to one tab stop. (default 4)
        statusBarMessage: (create, edit) - Extra string to display in the status bar when the mouse is over the control.
        storeContents: (create, edit) - If the provided string is a fully specified file path, then attempts to store the contents of this field to that path. Otherwise, uses the provided string as a filename only and uses an internally generated path and extension for the file, as used by the -loadContents and -removeStoredContents flags. In both cases, a new unique filename will be generated if the specified name exists. Returns the filename of the file saved upon completion, and an empty string otherwise.
        tabsForIndent: (create, edit, query) - Specifies whether tab characters should be inserted when indenting. (default on)

        backgroundColor: (create, edit, query) - The background color of the control. The arguments correspond to the red, green, and blue color components. Each component ranges in value from 0.0 to 1.0. When setting backgroundColor, the background is automatically enabled, unless enableBackground is also specified with a false value.
        clear: (create, edit) - Clears the field.
        copySelection: (create, edit) - Copies the current selection from this field.
        cutSelection: (create, edit) - Cuts the current selection from this field.
        defineTemplate: (create) - Puts the command in a mode where any other flags and arguments are parsed and added to the command template specified in the argument. They will be used as default arguments in any subsequent invocations of the command when templateName is set as the current template.
        docTag: (create, edit, query) - Add a documentation flag to the control.  The documentation flag has a directory structure. (e.g., -dt render/multiLister/createNode/material)
        dragCallback: (create, edit) - Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:  global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods)  The proc returns a string array that is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type.  Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers CTRL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTRL, 3 == CTRL + SHIFT.  In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form:  def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ):  The values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above.

The "dragControl" value is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be "print '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'")
        dropCallback: (create, edit) - Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:  global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int $y, int $type)  The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback. $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link.  In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form:  def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ):  The values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above.

They will be used as default arguments in any subsequent invocations of the command when templateName is set as the current template.
        docTag: (create, edit, query) - Add a documentation flag to the control.  The documentation flag has a directory structure. (e.g., -dt render/multiLister/createNode/material)
        dragCallback: (create, edit) - Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:  global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods)  The proc returns a string array that is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type.  Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers CTRL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTRL, 3 == CTRL + SHIFT.  In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form:  def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ):  The values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above.  The other way to specify the callback in Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys "dragControl", "x", "y", "modifiers".  The "dragControl" value is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be "print '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'")
        dragCommand: (create, edit) - Command executed when the value changes by dragging the slider's value marker.
        dropCallback: (create, edit) - Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:  global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int $y, int $type)  The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback. $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link.  In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form:  def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ):  The values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above.  The other way to specify the callback in Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys "dragControl", "dropControl", "messages", "x", "y", "type".  The "dragControl" value is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be "print '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'")
        enable: (create, edit, query) - The enable state of the control.  By default, this flag is set to true and the control is enabled.  Specify false and the control will appear dimmed or greyed-out indicating it is disabled.
        enableBackground: (create, edit, query) - Enables the background color of the control.
        enableKeyboardFocus: (create, edit, query) - If enabled, the user can navigate to the control with the tab key and select values with the keyboard or mouse. This flag would typically be used to turn off focus support from controls that get it by default, like Edit and List controls. If disabled, text in text fields can still be selected with the mouse but cannot be copied (except on Linux when "Middle Click Paste" is enabled).
        exists: (create) - Returns whether the specified object exists or not. Other flags are ignored.
        extraLabel: (create, edit, query) - Sets the string to be the text for the extra label.
        forceDragRefresh: (create, edit, query) - If used then force refresh on drag
        fullPathName: (query) - Return the full path name of the widget, which includes all the parents.
        height: (create, edit, query) - The height of the control.  The control will attempt to be this size if it is not overruled by parent layout conditions.
        highlightColor: (create, edit, query) - The highlight color of the control. The arguments correspond to the red, green, and blue color components. Each component ranges in value from 0.0 to 1.0.
        invisible: (create, edit, query) - Set the invisible color index.
        isObscured: (query) - Return whether the control can actually be seen by the user. The control will be obscured if its state is invisible, if it is blocked (entirely or partially) by some other control, if it or a parent layout is unmanaged, or if the control's window is invisible or iconified.
        label: (create, edit, query) - Label text for the group.
        manage: (create, edit, query) - Manage state of the control.  An unmanaged control is not visible, nor does it take up any screen real estate.  All controls are created managed by default.
        maxValue: (create, edit, query) - Maximum color index.
        minValue: (create, edit, query) - Minimum color index.
        noBackground: (create, edit) - Clear/reset the control's background. Passing true means the background should not be drawn at all, false means the background should be drawn.  The state of this flag is inherited by children of this control.
        numberOfPopupMenus: (query) - Return the number of popup menus attached to this control.
        parent: (create, query) - The parent layout for this control.
        popupMenuArray: (query) - Return the names of all the popup menus attached to this control.
        preventOverride: (create, edit, query) - If true, this flag prevents overriding the control's attribute via the control's right mouse button menu.
        rowAttach: (create, edit, multiuse) - Arguments are : column, attachment type, offset. Possible attachments are: top | bottom | both. Specifies attachment types and offsets for the entire row.
        statusBarMessage: (create, edit) - Extra string to display in the status bar when the mouse is over the control.
        useTemplate: (create) - Forces the command to use a command template other than the current one.
        value: (create, edit, query) - Color index.
        visible: (create, edit, query) - The visible state of the control.  A control is created visible by default.  Note that a control's actual appearance is also dependent on the visible state of its parent layout(s).
        visibleChangeCommand: (create, edit, query) - Command that gets executed when visible state of the control changes.
        width: (create, edit, query) - The width of the control.  The control will attempt to be this size if it is not overruled by parent layout conditions.

        columnOffset3: (create, edit) - This flag is used in conjunction with the -columnAttach3 flag.  If that flag is not used then this flag will be ignored.  It sets the offset for the three columns.  The offsets applied are based on the attachments specified with the -columnAttach3 flag.  Ignored if there are not exactly three columns.
        columnOffset4: (create, edit) - This flag is used in conjunction with the -columnAttach4 flag.  If that flag is not used then this flag will be ignored.

        defineTemplate: (create) - Puts the command in a mode where any other flags and arguments are parsed and added to the command template specified in the argument. They will be used as default arguments in any subsequent invocations of the command when templateName is set as the current template.
        docTag: (create, edit, query) - Add a documentation flag to the control.  The documentation flag has a directory structure. (e.g., -dt render/multiLister/createNode/material)
        dragCallback: (create, edit) - Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:  global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods)  The proc returns a string array that is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type.  Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers CTRL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTRL, 3 == CTRL + SHIFT.  In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form:  def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ):  The values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above.  The other way to specify the callback in Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys "dragControl", "x", "y", "modifiers".  The "dragControl" value is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be "print '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'")
        dropCallback: (create, edit) - Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:  global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int $y, int $type)  The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback. $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link.  In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form:  def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ):  The values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above.  The other way to specify the callback in Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys "dragControl", "dropControl", "messages", "x", "y", "type".  The "dragControl" value is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be "print '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'")
        enable: (create, edit, query) - The enable state of the control.  By default, this flag is set to true and the control is enabled.  Specify false and the control will appear dimmed or greyed-out indicating it is disabled.

        enableKeyboardFocus: (create, edit, query) - If enabled, the user can navigate to the control with the tab key and select values with the keyboard or mouse. This flag would typically be used to turn off focus support from controls that get it by default, like Edit and List controls. If disabled, text in text fields can still be selected with the mouse but cannot be copied (except on Linux when "Middle Click Paste" is enabled).
        exists: (create) - Returns whether the specified object exists or not. Other flags are ignored.
        forceDragRefresh: (create) - If used then force refresh on drag
        fullPathName: (query) - Return the full path name of the widget, which includes all the parents.

        hsvValue: (create, edit, query) - Color in hue, saturation, and value format.
        isObscured: (query) - Return whether the control can actually be seen by the user. The control will be obscured if its state is invisible, if it is blocked (entirely or partially) by some other control, if it or a parent layout is unmanaged, or if the control's window is invisible or iconified.
        label: (create, edit, query) - Label text for the group.
        manage: (create, edit, query) - Manage state of the control.  An unmanaged control is not visible, nor does it take up any screen real estate.  All controls are created managed by default.
        noBackground: (create, edit) - Clear/reset the control's background. Passing true means the background should not be drawn at all, false means the background should be drawn.  The state of this flag is inherited by children of this control.
        numberOfPopupMenus: (query) - Return the number of popup menus attached to this control.
        parent: (create, query) - The parent layout for this control.
        popupMenuArray: (query) - Return the names of all the popup menus attached to this control.

        statusBarMessage: (create, edit) - Extra string to display in the status bar when the mouse is over the control.
        useTemplate: (create) - Forces the command to use a command template other than the current one.
        visible: (create, edit, query) - The visible state of the control.  A control is created visible by default.  Note that a control's actual appearance is also dependent on the visible state of its parent layout(s).
        visibleChangeCommand: (create, edit, query) - Command that gets executed when visible state of the control changes.
        width: (create, edit, query) - The width of the control.  The control will attempt to be this size if it is not overruled by parent layout conditions.

        docTag: (create, edit, query) - Add a documentation flag to the control.  The documentation flag has a directory structure. (e.g., -dt render/multiLister/createNode/material)
        dragCallback: (create, edit) - Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:  global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods)  The proc returns a string array that is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type.  Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers CTRL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTRL, 3 == CTRL + SHIFT.  In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form:  def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ):  The values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above.  The other way to specify the callback in Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys "dragControl", "x", "y", "modifiers".  The "dragControl" value is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be "print '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'")
        dragCommand: (create, edit) - Command string executed when slider value marker is dragged.
        dropCallback: (create, edit) - Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:  global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int $y, int $type)  The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback. $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link.  In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form:  def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ):  The values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above.  The other way to specify the callback in Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys "dragControl", "dropControl", "messages", "x", "y", "type".  The "dragControl" value is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be "print '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'")
        enable: (create, edit, query) - The enable state of the control.  By default, this flag is set to true and the control is enabled.  Specify false and the control will appear dimmed or greyed-out indicating it is disabled.
        enableBackground: (create, edit, query) - Enables the background color of the control.
        enableKeyboardFocus: (create, edit, query) - If enabled, the user can navigate to the control with the tab key and select values with the keyboard or mouse. This flag would typically be used to turn off focus support from controls that get it by default, like Edit and List controls. If disabled, text in text fields can still be selected with the mouse but cannot be copied (except on Linux when "Middle Click Paste" is enabled).
        exists: (create) - Returns whether the specified object exists or not. Other flags are ignored.
        forceDragRefresh: (create, edit, query) - If used then force refresh on drag
        fullPathName: (query) - Return the full path name of the widget, which includes all the parents.
        height: (create, edit, query) - The height of the control.  The control will attempt to be this size if it is not overruled by parent layout conditions.
        highlightColor: (create, edit, query) - The highlight color of the control. The arguments correspond to the red, green, and blue color components. Each component ranges in value from 0.0 to 1.0.
        hsvValue: (create, edit, query) - Color in hue, saturation, and value format.
        isObscured: (query) - Return whether the control can actually be seen by the user. The control will be obscured if its state is invisible, if it is blocked (entirely or partially) by some other control, if it or a parent layout is unmanaged, or if the control's window is invisible or iconified.
        label: (create, edit, query) - Label text for the group.
        manage: (create, edit, query) - Manage state of the control.  An unmanaged control is not visible, nor does it take up any screen real estate.  All controls are created managed by default.
        noBackground: (create, edit) - Clear/reset the control's background. Passing true means the background should not be drawn at all, false means the background should be drawn.  The state of this flag is inherited by children of this control.
        numberOfPopupMenus: (query) - Return the number of popup menus attached to this control.
        parent: (create, query) - The parent layout for this control.
        popupMenuArray: (query) - Return the names of all the popup menus attached to this control.
        preventOverride: (create, edit, query) - If true, this flag prevents overriding the control's attribute via the control's right mouse button menu.
        rgbValue: (create, edit, query) - Color in red, green, and blue format.
        rowAttach: (create, edit, multiuse) - Arguments are : column, attachment type, offset. Possible attachments are: top | bottom | both. Specifies attachment types and offsets for the entire row.
        statusBarMessage: (create, edit) - Extra string to display in the status bar when the mouse is over the control.
        useDisplaySpace: (create, edit, query) - Set the command call to be done in display space. This sets the color picker to display space. Using the flag when setting or getting the color also converts it accordingly.
        useTemplate: (create) - Forces the command to use a command template other than the current one.
        useVpColorPicker: (create, edit) - Enabled to sample the 32bit float version from the viewport instead of the 8 bit integer that QT sees. Note that the viewport color picker does not allow to pick color on hud elements.
        visible: (create, edit, query) - The visible state of the control.  A control is created visible by default.  Note that a control's actual appearance is also dependent on the visible state of its parent layout(s).
        visibleChangeCommand: (create, edit, query) - Command that gets executed when visible state of the control changes.
        width: (create, edit, query) - The width of the control.  The control will attempt to be this size if it is not overruled by parent layout conditions.

    This command creates a single line for command input/output.

    Args:
        annotation: (create, edit, query) - Annotate the control with an extra string value.
        backgroundColor: (create, edit, query) - The background color of the control. The arguments correspond to the red, green, and blue color components. Each component ranges in value from 0.0 to 1.0. When setting backgroundColor, the background is automatically enabled, unless enableBackground is also specified with a false value.
        command: (create, edit) - Command executed when the command line text changes.
        defineTemplate: (create) - Puts the command in a mode where any other flags and arguments are parsed and added to the command template specified in the argument. They will be used as default arguments in any subsequent invocations of the command when templateName is set as the current template.
        docTag: (create, edit, query) - Add a documentation flag to the control.  The documentation flag has a directory structure. (e.g., -dt render/multiLister/createNode/material)
        dragCallback: (create, edit) - Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:  global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods)  The proc returns a string array that is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type.  Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers CTRL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTRL, 3 == CTRL + SHIFT.  In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form:  def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ):  The values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above.  The other way to specify the callback in Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys "dragControl", "x", "y", "modifiers".  The "dragControl" value is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be "print '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'")
        dropCallback: (create, edit) - Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:  global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int $y, int $type)  The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback. $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link.  In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form:  def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ):  The values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above.  The other way to specify the callback in Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys "dragControl", "dropControl", "messages", "x", "y", "type".  The "dragControl" value is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be "print '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'")
        enable: (create, edit, query) - The enable state of the control.  By default, this flag is set to true and the control is enabled.  Specify false and the control will appear dimmed or greyed-out indicating it is disabled.
        enableBackground: (create, edit, query) - Enables the background color of the control.
        enableKeyboardFocus: (create, edit, query) - If enabled, the user can navigate to the control with the tab key and select values with the keyboard or mouse. This flag would typically be used to turn off focus support from controls that get it by default, like Edit and List controls. If disabled, text in text fields can still be selected with the mouse but cannot be copied (except on Linux when "Middle Click Paste" is enabled).
        enterCommand: (create, edit) - Command executed when the keypad 'Enter' key is pressed.
        exists: (create) - Returns whether the specified object exists or not. Other flags are ignored.
        fullPathName: (query) - Return the full path name of the widget, which includes all the parents.
        height: (create, edit, query) - The height of the control.  The control will attempt to be this size if it is not overruled by parent layout conditions.
        highlightColor: (create, edit, query) - The highlight color of the control. The arguments correspond to the red, green, and blue color components. Each component ranges in value from 0.0 to 1.0.
        holdFocus: (create, edit, query) - Sets whether the command line should hold focus after exectuing a command.
        inputAnnotation: (create, edit, query) - Annotate the input field with an extra string value.
        isObscured: (query) - Return whether the control can actually be seen by the user. The control will be obscured if its state is invisible, if it is blocked (entirely or partially) by some other control, if it or a parent layout is unmanaged, or if the control's window is invisible or iconified.
        manage: (create, edit, query) - Manage state of the control.  An unmanaged control is not visible, nor does it take up any screen real estate.  All controls are created managed by default.
        noBackground: (create, edit) - Clear/reset the control's background. Passing true means the background should not be drawn at all, false means the background should be drawn.  The state of this flag is inherited by children of this control.
        numberOfHistoryLines: (create, edit, query) - Sets the maximum number of commands saved to the command line history. Up to -nhl/numberOfHistoryLines previous commands will be available by pressing the up-arrow from within the input field. The default value is 50.
        numberOfPopupMenus: (query) - Return the number of popup menus attached to this control.
        outputAnnotation: (create, edit, query) - Annotate the output field with an extra string value.
        parent: (create, query) - The parent layout for this control.
        popupMenuArray: (query) - Return the names of all the popup menus attached to this control.
        preventOverride: (create, edit, query) - If true, this flag prevents overriding the control's attribute via the control's right mouse button menu.
        sourceType: (create, edit, query) - Sets the source type of this command line. Currently supports "mel" (enabled by default) and "python".
        statusBarMessage: (create, edit) - Extra string to display in the status bar when the mouse is over the control.
        useTemplate: (create) - Forces the command to use a command template other than the current one.
        visible: (create, edit, query) - The visible state of the control.  A control is created visible by default.  Note that a control's actual appearance is also dependent on the visible state of its parent layout(s).
        visibleChangeCommand: (create, edit, query) - Command that gets executed when visible state of the control changes.
        width: (create, edit, query) - The width of the control.  The control will attempt to be this size if it is not overruled by parent layout conditions.

        floatSlider: (create, edit, query) - assigns a float slider that the component editor will use for editing groups of values.
        forceMainConnection: (create, edit, query) - Specifies the name of a selectionConnection object that the editor will use as its source of content. The editor will only display items contained in the selectionConnection object. This is a variant of the -mainListConnection flag in that it will force a change even when the connection is locked. This flag is used to reduce the overhead when using the -unlockMainConnection , -mainListConnection, -lockMainConnection flags in immediate succession.
        hidePathName: (create, edit, query) - Hides path name of displayed element.  By default this flag is set to false.
        hideZeroColumns: (create, edit, query) - Hides columns whose elements are all zero.  By default this flag is set to false.
        highlightConnection: (create, edit, query) - Specifies the name of a selectionConnection object that the editor will synchronize with its highlight list. Not all editors have a highlight list. For those that do, it is a secondary selection list.
        justifyHeaders: (create, edit, query) - Set justification mode for headers of columns.  Possible values are 0 (right justify), or 1 (left justify). By default this flag is set to 0.
        lockInput: (create, edit, query) - Prevents the editor from responding to changes in the active list. Independent of selection connection.
        lockMainConnection: (create, edit) - Locks the current list of objects within the mainConnection, so that only those objects are displayed within the editor. Further changes to the original mainConnection are ignored.
        mainListConnection: (create, edit, query) - Specifies the name of a selectionConnection object that the editor will use as its source of content. The editor will only display items contained in the selectionConnection object.
        newTab: (create, edit) - Creates a new tab, named by the first argument, based on an existing tab, given as the second argument using elements from a set, given in the third argument
        normalizeWeights: (edit) - Specifies automatic normalization mode of skin clusters. Can be 0, meaning "None", or 1, meaning "Interactive", or 2, meaning "Post". It corresponds to the "normalizeWeights" attribute of skinCluster node.
        operationCount: (query) - returns the total number of operation types known to the component editor.
        operationLabels: (query) - returns a string array containing the names for all operation types known to the editor.
        operationType: (create, edit, query) - Tells the editor which of its known operation types it should be performing. This is a 0-based index.
        panel: (create, query) - Specifies the panel for this editor. By default if an editor is created in the create callback of a scripted panel it will belong to that panel. If an editor does not belong to a panel it will be deleted when the window that it is in is deleted.
        parent: (create, edit, query) - Specifies the parent layout for this editor. This flag will only have an effect if the editor is currently un-parented.
        precision: (create, edit, query) - Specifies the maximum number of digits displayed to the right of the decimal place.  Can be 0 to 20.
        removeTab: (edit) - Removes the tab based on the set provided
        selected: (query) - Returns a list of strings, containing the labels of the currently selected columns
        selectionConnection: (create, edit, query) - Specifies the name of a selectionConnection object that the editor will synchronize with its own selection list. As the user selects things in this editor, they will be selected in the selectionConnection object. If the object undergoes changes, the editor updates to show the changes.
        setOperationLabel: (edit) - uses the string as the new name for the existing operation type specified by the integer index. Note that there is no messaging system which allows UI to be informed of changes made by this flag.
        showNamespaces: (create, edit, query) - Show the namespaces for objects, if any.  By default this flag is set to true.
        showObjects: (create) - Restricts the display to columns that are in the current active list.
        showSelected: (create, edit) - Restricts the display to those columns which are currently selected. By default this flag is set to false, so all columns are selected. The results from this flag obey the current -hideZeroColumns setting.
        sortAlpha: (create, edit, query) - Controls alphabetical (true), or hierarchical sorting of columns
        stateString: (query) - Query only flag. Returns the MEL command that will create an editor to match the current editor state. The returned command string uses the string variable $editorName in place of a specific name.
        unParent: (create, edit) - Specifies that the editor should be removed from its layout. This cannot be used in query mode.
        unlockMainConnection: (create, edit) - Unlocks the mainConnection, effectively restoring the original mainConnection (if it is still available), and dynamic updates.
        updateMainConnection: (create, edit) - Causes a locked mainConnection to be updated from the orginal mainConnection, but preserves the lock state.

    This command is used to edit and query a Content Browser. The Content Browser is a unique panel, so only one instance of it can exist at a given time. The optional argument is the name of the control.

    Args:
        addContentPath: (edit) - Adds the given path(s) to the libraries displayed on the Examples tab. Also updates the corresponding MAYA_CONTENT_PATH environment variable.
        context: (edit, query) - Sets the default location for the given context. The two optional arguments (Python only) are the category (tab) and location. To clear the content use empty strings for category and location.  In query mode, it returns the context of the content browser in an array of 3 strings : the name of the context, the default category name, the default location.
        control: (query) - Query only. Returns the top level control for this editor. Usually used for getting a parent to attach popup menus. Caution: It is possible for an editor to exist without a control. The query will return "NONE" if no control is present.
        defineTemplate: (create) - Puts the command in a mode where any other flags and arguments are parsed and added to the command template specified in the argument. They will be used as default arguments in any subsequent invocations of the command when templateName is set as the current template.
        docTag: (create, edit, query) - Attaches a tag to the editor.
        exists: (create) - Returns whether the specified object exists or not. Other flags are ignored.
        filter: (create, edit, query) - Specifies the name of an itemFilter object to be used with this editor. This filters the information coming onto the main list of the editor.
        forceMainConnection: (create, edit, query) - Specifies the name of a selectionConnection object that the editor will use as its source of content. The editor will only display items contained in the selectionConnection object. This is a variant of the -mainListConnection flag in that it will force a change even when the connection is locked. This flag is used to reduce the overhead when using the -unlockMainConnection , -mainListConnection, -lockMainConnection flags in immediate succession.
        highlightConnection: (create, edit, query) - Specifies the name of a selectionConnection object that the editor will synchronize with its highlight list. Not all editors have a highlight list. For those that do, it is a secondary selection list.
        location: (edit) - Switches to the Examples tab and selects the given library location.
        lockMainConnection: (create, edit) - Locks the current list of objects within the mainConnection, so that only those objects are displayed within the editor. Further changes to the original mainConnection are ignored.
        mainListConnection: (create, edit, query) - Specifies the name of a selectionConnection object that the editor will use as its source of content. The editor will only display items contained in the selectionConnection object.
        panel: (create, query) - Specifies the panel for this editor. By default if an editor is created in the create callback of a scripted panel it will belong to that panel. If an editor does not belong to a panel it will be deleted when the window that it is in is deleted.
        parent: (create, edit, query) - Specifies the parent layout for this editor. This flag will only have an effect if the editor is currently un-parented.
        preview: (edit) - Shows / hides the preview panel. Note: this flag will not affect the currently opened Content Browser, but only any subsequently opened ones.
        refreshTreeView: (edit) - Forces a refresh of the Examples tab tree view pane.
        removeContentPath: (edit) - Removes the given path(s) from the libraries displayed on the Examples tab. Also updates the corresponding MAYA_CONTENT_PATH environment variable.
        saveCurrentContext: (edit) - Saves the context for the current Content Browser tab.
        selectionConnection: (create, edit, query) - Specifies the name of a selectionConnection object that the editor will synchronize with its own selection list. As the user selects things in this editor, they will be selected in the selectionConnection object. If the object undergoes changes, the editor updates to show the changes.
        stateString: (query) - Query only flag. Returns the MEL command that will create an editor to match the current editor state. The returned command string uses the string variable $editorName in place of a specific name.
        thumbnailView: (edit) - Shows / hides the thumbnail panel. Note: this flag will not affect the currently opened Content Browser, but only any subsequently opened ones.
        treeView: (edit) - Shows / hides the tree view panel. Note: this flag will not affect the currently opened Content Browser, but only any subsequently opened ones.
        unParent: (create, edit) - Specifies that the editor should be removed from its layout. This cannot be used in query mode.
        unlockMainConnection: (create, edit) - Unlocks the mainConnection, effectively restoring the original mainConnection (if it is still available), and dynamic updates.
        updateMainConnection: (create, edit) - Causes a locked mainConnection to be updated from the orginal mainConnection, but preserves the lock state.
        useTemplate: (create) - Forces the command to use a command template other than the current one.

    This command allows you to edit or query the properties of any control.

    Args:
        annotation: (create, edit, query) - Annotate the control with an extra string value.
        backgroundColor: (create, edit, query) - The background color of the control. The arguments correspond to the red, green, and blue color components. Each component ranges in value from 0.0 to 1.0. When setting backgroundColor, the background is automatically enabled, unless enableBackground is also specified with a false value.
        defineTemplate: (create) - Puts the command in a mode where any other flags and arguments are parsed and added to the command template specified in the argument. They will be used as default arguments in any subsequent invocations of the command when templateName is set as the current template.
        docTag: (create, edit, query) - Add a documentation flag to the control.  The documentation flag has a directory structure. (e.g., -dt render/multiLister/createNode/material)
        dragCallback: (create, edit) - Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:  global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods)  The proc returns a string array that is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type.  Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers CTRL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTRL, 3 == CTRL + SHIFT.  In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form:  def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ):  The values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above.  The other way to specify the callback in Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys "dragControl", "x", "y", "modifiers".  The "dragControl" value is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be "print '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'")
        dropCallback: (create, edit) - Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:  global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int $y, int $type)  The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback. $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link.  In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form:  def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ):  The values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above.  The other way to specify the callback in Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys "dragControl", "dropControl", "messages", "x", "y", "type".  The "dragControl" value is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be "print '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'")
        enable: (create, edit, query) - The enable state of the control.  By default, this flag is set to true and the control is enabled.  Specify false and the control will appear dimmed or greyed-out indicating it is disabled.
        enableBackground: (create, edit, query) - Enables the background color of the control.
        enableKeyboardFocus: (create, edit, query) - If enabled, the user can navigate to the control with the tab key and select values with the keyboard or mouse. This flag would typically be used to turn off focus support from controls that get it by default, like Edit and List controls. If disabled, text in text fields can still be selected with the mouse but cannot be copied (except on Linux when "Middle Click Paste" is enabled).
        exists: (create) - Returns whether the specified object exists or not. Other flags are ignored.
        fullPathName: (query) - Return the full path name of the widget, which includes all the parents.
        height: (create, edit, query) - The height of the control.  The control will attempt to be this size if it is not overruled by parent layout conditions.
        highlightColor: (create, edit, query) - The highlight color of the control. The arguments correspond to the red, green, and blue color components. Each component ranges in value from 0.0 to 1.0.
        isObscured: (query) - Return whether the control can actually be seen by the user. The control will be obscured if its state is invisible, if it is blocked (entirely or partially) by some other control, if it or a parent layout is unmanaged, or if the control's window is invisible or iconified.
        manage: (create, edit, query) - Manage state of the control.  An unmanaged control is not visible, nor does it take up any screen real estate.  All controls are created managed by default.
        noBackground: (create, edit) - Clear/reset the control's background. Passing true means the background should not be drawn at all, false means the background should be drawn.  The state of this flag is inherited by children of this control.
        numberOfPopupMenus: (query) - Return the number of popup menus attached to this control.
        parent: (create, query) - The parent layout for this control.
        popupMenuArray: (query) - Return the names of all the popup menus attached to this control.

        statusBarMessage: (create, edit) - Extra string to display in the status bar when the mouse is over the control.
        useTemplate: (create) - Forces the command to use a command template other than the current one.
        visible: (create, edit, query) - The visible state of the control.  A control is created visible by default.  Note that a control's actual appearance is also dependent on the visible state of its parent layout(s).
        visibleChangeCommand: (create, edit, query) - Command that gets executed when visible state of the control changes.
        width: (create, edit, query) - The width of the control.  The control will attempt to be this size if it is not overruled by parent layout conditions.

If the source is specified (as node.attribute or simply as node), the command will proceed immediately. If the source is not specified, the user will be prompted to specify one. Once a source has been specified, a best guess will be made about what the user is trying to accomplish by connecting the two, based on the type of source and type of destination.

        destination: (create) - Specifies an existing destination attribute for a createNew or connectToExisting.
        disconnect: (create) - If used then disconnect the destination if it exists.
        force: (create) - If set to true, then an attempt to connect a source attribute to a destination attribute which already has a source will cause the existing source to be disconnected and the new source to be connected in its place. Default value is true.
        ignore: (create) - Ignore any connections flowing into the node.attribute specified by the destination flag.
        navigatorDecisionString: (create) - This is your opportunity to pass the navigator a string that can help it decide what behaviour to execute.

        splitLayout: (create) - When two windows are added to a single docking area they are by default tabbed together. Setting a value for splitLayout will allow it to be placed next to another control in the same area. The flag's argument controls the orientation of the split. Valid values are "horizontal" or "vertical".
        state: (create, edit, query) - When queried this flag will return a string holding the dock control state information. This string is a hexadecimal representation of a binary string and is not meant to be humanly readable, but can be saved and loaded using the optionVar command to restore a dock control's state across sessions of Maya.
        statusBarMessage: (create, edit) - Extra string to display in the status bar when the mouse is over the control.

        control: (query) - Query only. Returns the top level control for this editor. Usually used for getting a parent to attach popup menus. Caution: It is possible for an editor to exist without a control. The query will return "NONE" if no control is present.
        defineTemplate: (create) - Puts the command in a mode where any other flags and arguments are parsed and added to the command template specified in the argument. They will be used as default arguments in any subsequent invocations of the command when templateName is set as the current template.
        docTag: (create, edit, query) - Attaches a tag to the editor.
        exists: (create) - Returns whether the specified object exists or not. Other flags are ignored.
        filter: (create, edit, query) - Specifies the name of an itemFilter object to be used with this editor. This filters the information coming onto the main list of the editor.
        forceMainConnection: (create, edit, query) - Specifies the name of a selectionConnection object that the editor will use as its source of content. The editor will only display items contained in the selectionConnection object. This is a variant of the -mainListConnection flag in that it will force a change even when the connection is locked. This flag is used to reduce the overhead when using the -unlockMainConnection , -mainListConnection, -lockMainConnection flags in immediate succession.
        highlightConnection: (create, edit, query) - Specifies the name of a selectionConnection object that the editor will synchronize with its highlight list. Not all editors have a highlight list. For those that do, it is a secondary selection list.
        lockMainConnection: (create, edit) - Locks the current list of objects within the mainConnection, so that only those objects are displayed within the editor. Further changes to the original mainConnection are ignored.
        mainListConnection: (create, edit, query) - Specifies the name of a selectionConnection object that the editor will use as its source of content. The editor will only display items contained in the selectionConnection object.
        panel: (create, query) - Specifies the panel for this editor. By default if an editor is created in the create callback of a scripted panel it will belong to that panel. If an editor does not belong to a panel it will be deleted when the window that it is in is deleted.
        parent: (create, edit, query) - Specifies the parent layout for this editor. This flag will only have an effect if the editor is currently un-parented.
        selectionConnection: (create, edit, query) - Specifies the name of a selectionConnection object that the editor will synchronize with its own selection list. As the user selects things in this editor, they will be selected in the selectionConnection object. If the object undergoes changes, the editor updates to show the changes.
        stateString: (query) - Query only flag. Returns the MEL command that will create an editor to match the current editor state. The returned command string uses the string variable $editorName in place of a specific name.
        unParent: (create, edit) - Specifies that the editor should be removed from its layout. This cannot be used in query mode.
        unlockMainConnection: (create, edit) - Unlocks the mainConnection, effectively restoring the original mainConnection (if it is still available), and dynamic updates.
        updateMainConnection: (create, edit) - Causes a locked mainConnection to be updated from the orginal mainConnection, but preserves the lock state.

    The editorTemplate command allows the user to specify the conceptual layout of an attribute editor and leave the details of exactly which UI elements are used in the final result to the automatic dialog generation mechanism.

    Args:
        addAdskAssetControls: (create) - Adds controls for dynamic attributes of adskMaterial nodes and organizes them in a layout according to the XML ui description specified in the asset library.
        addComponents: (create) - This flag will add a frameLayout with a channel box which will display any selected components for the object.
        addControl: (create) - The first argument is the name of the attribute for which you wish to add a control. You can assume that when the editor is created from the template, an appropriate type of control will be used. The second string argument is optional, and can be used to specify a command (or script) to be executed when the attribute is changed.
        addDynamicControl: (create) - As -addControl with the exception that the attribute for which the control is to be created/attached is dynamic. [Note: -addControl will also work for dynamic attributes, but will not preserve their order in the attribute editor].
        addExtraControls: (create) - By default, if there are attributes of a node which you do not -addControl or -suppress, then controls will be created automatically and appended to the end of editor created from the template. This flag allows you to specify a particular place in the template for such controls to be automatically inserted. If dynamic attributes have not already been addressed with -addControl, they will also be placed here.  A frameLayout will automatically be generated for you when you use this flag.
        addSeparator: (create) - Adds a separator to the template.
        annotateFieldOnly: (create) - This flag can only be used with the -annotation flag.  By default, for any Attribute Editor controlGroups created by the -addControl flag, the -annotation flag displays its annotation string when the mouse hovers over any control that is part (the label, the value field, etc.) of the group.  Use this flag to limit display of the annotation to only the value field of the controlGroup.  This flag is ignored if the controlGroup has no value field (e.g., checkBoxGrp)
        annotation: (create) - This flag can only be used with the -addControl or the -addDynamicControl flags. The string will be used as an annotation on the controls created in the attribute editor.
        beginLayout: (create) - Begins a layout in the template with the title specified by the string argument. Items between this flag and    its corresponding -endLayout flag will be contained within the layout. You can assume that when the editor is created from the template, an appropriate type of layout will be used. (frameLayout).
        beginNoOptimize: (create) - Specifies that the layout of items between this flag and its corresponding -endNoOptimize flag is not to be optimized to minimize space.
        beginScrollLayout: (create) - Begins a scrollLayout.  Items between this flag and its corresponding -endScrollLayout flag will be contained within the layout.
        callCustom: (create) - Specifies that at this point in the template when building the dialog, the procedure specified by the first argument is to be called to create some UI objects when a new node type is edited. The procedure specified by the second argument is to be called if an attribute editor already exists and another node of the same type is now to be edited. The replacing procedure should connect any controls created by the creating procedure to the equivalent attributes in the new node. A list of zero or more attributes specifies the attributes which the two procedures will involve. The procedures should have the signature:  proc AEcustomNew(string attributeName1, string attributeName2)  The number of attributes specified in the call should correspond to the number of attributes in the procedure signature.
        collapse: (create) - This flag is only valid when used in conjunction with a -bl/beginLayout flag.  It is used to specify the initial expand/collapse state of the layout.  A true value will cause the layout to be collapsed upon creation, while a false value will expand the layout.  The default is true (ie. collapsed).
        debugMode: (create) - Set debugging mode for the template
        dimControl: (create) - This flag is only useful AFTER a control has already been created (using the -addControl flag).  The first argument is the node name and the second is the attribute whose control you wish to affect.  The third argument is a boolean which specifies whether to dim (true) or undim (false) the associated control.
        endLayout: (create) - Ends a layout in the template started by -beginLayout.
        endNoOptimize: (create) - Ends a set of non-optimized items.
        endScrollLayout: (create) - Ends a scrollLayout.
        extraControlsLabel: (create) - By default the label is "Extra Attributes". Specify an alternate label or an empty string to hide the label. This flag must be used in conjuction with the -aec/addExtraControls flag.
        forceRebuild: (create) - Force a template to always destroy/create itself rather than use the replace feature.  Both the default replace behavior and force rebuild preserve the collapse/expand status of all the layout sections.
        interruptOptimize: (create) - Enforces a division between two sets of items whose layouts may be optimized.
        label: (create) - This flag can only be used with the -addControl or the -addDynamicControl flags.  And it must be specified FIRST. The string will override the name of the attribute that will be displayed in the attribute editor.
        listExtraAttributes: (create) - List extra attributes.This flag is only useful AFTER a control has already been created (using the -addControl flag). The first argument is the node name.
        preventOverride: (create) - If true, this flag disallows overriding the control's attribute via the control's right mouse button menu.
        queryControl: (create) - This flag is only useful AFTER a control has already been created (using the -addControl flag).  The first argument is the node name and the second is the attribute whose control you wish to query.  Note that in most cases, using this flag is identical to issuing a getAttr command, however, in the case of textFields (e.g. for message attributes), the text value currently being displayed will be returned, NOT the actual attribute value.
        queryLabel: (create) - This flag is only useful AFTER a control has already been created (using the -addControl flag).  The first argument is the node name and the second is the attribute whose control label you wish to query.  In most cases this flag returns the same value as the attribute's nice name, but when a -label flag was present on the -addControl command that created the control, -queryLabel will return that value instead
        queryName: (create) - This flag is only useful AFTER a control has already been created (using the -addControl flag).  The first argument is the node name and the second is the attribute whose control name you wish to query.
        suppress: (create) - Prevent a control for the attribute specified by the string argument from appearing in the editor created from the template.

        annotation: (create, edit, query) - Annotate the control with an extra string value.
        asString: (edit, query) - Used to query and set the value of the curve as a string of comma separated values
        backgroundColor: (create, edit, query) - The background color of the control. The arguments correspond to the red, green, and blue color components. Each component ranges in value from 0.0 to 1.0. When setting backgroundColor, the background is automatically enabled, unless enableBackground is also specified with a false value.
        changeCommand: (edit) - Specifies a command to be executed whenever the value of this curve is modified. This option should not be used when specifying an optionVar.
        currentKey: (create, edit, query) - Returns the index of the currently selected key.
        currentKeyValue: (edit, query) - Get or set the value of the currently selected key.
        customCurveWidget: (create, edit, query) - Determines whether or not the curve widget is using a custom curve. When a custom curve is used, it is stored by a falloff curve in the brush tool settings, and the flag should be true.
        defineTemplate: (create) - Puts the command in a mode where any other flags and arguments are parsed and added to the command template specified in the argument. They will be used as default arguments in any subsequent invocations of the command when templateName is set as the current template.
        deleteControlVertex: (edit) - Used to delete a control vertex of the curve.
        docTag: (create, edit, query) - Add a documentation flag to the control.  The documentation flag has a directory structure. (e.g., -dt render/multiLister/createNode/material)
        dragCallback: (create, edit) - Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:  global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods)  The proc returns a string array that is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type.  Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers CTRL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTRL, 3 == CTRL + SHIFT.  In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form:  def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ):  The values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above.  The other way to specify the callback in Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys "dragControl", "x", "y", "modifiers".  The "dragControl" value is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be "print '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'")
        dropCallback: (create, edit) - Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:  global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int $y, int $type)  The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback. $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link.  In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form:  def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ):  The values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above.  The other way to specify the callback in Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys "dragControl", "dropControl", "messages", "x", "y", "type".  The "dragControl" value is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be "print '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'")
        enable: (create, edit, query) - The enable state of the control.  By default, this flag is set to true and the control is enabled.  Specify false and the control will appear dimmed or greyed-out indicating it is disabled.
        enableBackground: (create, edit, query) - Enables the background color of the control.
        enableKeyboardFocus: (create, edit, query) - If enabled, the user can navigate to the control with the tab key and select values with the keyboard or mouse. This flag would typically be used to turn off focus support from controls that get it by default, like Edit and List controls. If disabled, text in text fields can still be selected with the mouse but cannot be copied (except on Linux when "Middle Click Paste" is enabled).
        exists: (create) - Returns whether the specified object exists or not. Other flags are ignored.
        fullPathName: (query) - Return the full path name of the widget, which includes all the parents.
        height: (create, edit, query) - The height of the control.  The control will attempt to be this size if it is not overruled by parent layout conditions.
        highlightColor: (create, edit, query) - The highlight color of the control. The arguments correspond to the red, green, and blue color components. Each component ranges in value from 0.0 to 1.0.
        isObscured: (query) - Return whether the control can actually be seen by the user. The control will be obscured if its state is invisible, if it is blocked (entirely or partially) by some other control, if it or a parent layout is unmanaged, or if the control's window is invisible or iconified.
        manage: (create, edit, query) - Manage state of the control.  An unmanaged control is not visible, nor does it take up any screen real estate.  All controls are created managed by default.
        noBackground: (create, edit) - Clear/reset the control's background. Passing true means the background should not be drawn at all, false means the background should be drawn.  The state of this flag is inherited by children of this control.
        numberOfPopupMenus: (query) - Return the number of popup menus attached to this control.
        optionVar: (create, edit, query) - Specifies the name of the option var used to store and retrieve the string value capturing the curve.
        parent: (create, query) - The parent layout for this control.
        popupMenuArray: (query) - Return the names of all the popup menus attached to this control.
        preventOverride: (create, edit, query) - If true, this flag prevents overriding the control's attribute via the control's right mouse button menu.
        readOnly: (create, edit, query) - Specifies if the curve is read only or not. If true, the curve can't be edited.
        snapToGrid: (create, edit, query) - Specifies whether or not curve control points snap to grid when they are being moved.
        statusBarMessage: (create, edit) - Extra string to display in the status bar when the mouse is over the control.
        useTemplate: (create) - Forces the command to use a command template other than the current one.
        visible: (create, edit, query) - The visible state of the control.  A control is created visible by default.  Note that a control's actual appearance is also dependent on the visible state of its parent layout(s).
        visibleChangeCommand: (create, edit, query) - Command that gets executed when visible state of the control changes.

    Create a field control that accepts only float values and is bound by a minimum and maximum value.  An invisible slider is attached to the field and accessed by holding down the Ctrl modifier key while pressing one of the mouse buttons.  Dragging the invisible slider to the right with the middle mouse button increases the field value by the amount specified with the

    Args:
        annotation: (create, edit, query) - Annotate the control with an extra string value.
        backgroundColor: (create, edit, query) - The background color of the control. The arguments correspond to the red, green, and blue color components. Each component ranges in value from 0.0 to 1.0. When setting backgroundColor, the background is automatically enabled, unless enableBackground is also specified with a false value.
        changeCommand: (create, edit) - Command executed when the field changes.  This command is not invoked when the value changes via the -v/value flag.
        defineTemplate: (create) - Puts the command in a mode where any other flags and arguments are parsed and added to the command template specified in the argument. They will be used as default arguments in any subsequent invocations of the command when templateName is set as the current template.
        docTag: (create, edit, query) - Add a documentation flag to the control.  The documentation flag has a directory structure. (e.g., -dt render/multiLister/createNode/material)
        dragCallback: (create, edit) - Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:  global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods)  The proc returns a string array that is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type.  Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers CTRL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTRL, 3 == CTRL + SHIFT.  In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form:  def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ):  The values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above.  The other way to specify the callback in Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys "dragControl", "x", "y", "modifiers".  The "dragControl" value is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be "print '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'")
        dragCommand: (create, edit) - Command executed when dragging in the field.
        dropCallback: (create, edit) - Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:  global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int $y, int $type)  The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback. $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link.  In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form:  def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ):  The values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above.  The other way to specify the callback in Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys "dragControl", "dropControl", "messages", "x", "y", "type".  The "dragControl" value is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be "print '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'")
        editable: (create, edit, query) - The edit state of the field.  By default, this flag is set to true and the field value may be changed by typing into it.  If false then the field can not be changed interactively.  However, you can change the field text with the -v/value flag regardless of the state of the -ed/editable flag.
        enable: (create, edit, query) - The enable state of the control.  By default, this flag is set to true and the control is enabled.  Specify false and the control will appear dimmed or greyed-out indicating it is disabled.
        enableBackground: (create, edit, query) - Enables the background color of the control.
        enableKeyboardFocus: (create, edit, query) - If enabled, the user can navigate to the control with the tab key and select values with the keyboard or mouse. This flag would typically be used to turn off focus support from controls that get it by default, like Edit and List controls. If disabled, text in text fields can still be selected with the mouse but cannot be copied (except on Linux when "Middle Click Paste" is enabled).
        enterCommand: (create, edit) - Command executed when the keypad 'Enter' key is pressed.
        exists: (create) - Returns whether the specified object exists or not. Other flags are ignored.
        fullPathName: (query) - Return the full path name of the widget, which includes all the parents.
        height: (create, edit, query) - The height of the control.  The control will attempt to be this size if it is not overruled by parent layout conditions.
        highlightColor: (create, edit, query) - The highlight color of the control. The arguments correspond to the red, green, and blue color components. Each component ranges in value from 0.0 to 1.0.

        maxValue: (create, edit, query) - Upper limit of the field.
        minValue: (create, edit, query) - Lower limit of the field.
        noBackground: (create, edit) - Clear/reset the control's background. Passing true means the background should not be drawn at all, false means the background should be drawn.  The state of this flag is inherited by children of this control.
        numberOfPopupMenus: (query) - Return the number of popup menus attached to this control.
        parent: (create, query) - The parent layout for this control.
        popupMenuArray: (query) - Return the names of all the popup menus attached to this control.
        precision: (create, edit, query) - Number of digits to the right of the decimal place.
        preventOverride: (create, edit, query) - If true, this flag prevents overriding the control's attribute via the control's right mouse button menu.
        receiveFocusCommand: (create, edit) - Command executed when the field receives focus.
        showTrailingZeros: (create, edit, query) - Show trailing zeros or not
        statusBarMessage: (create, edit) - Extra string to display in the status bar when the mouse is over the control.
        step: (create, edit, query) - Increment for the invisible slider.   The field value will change by this amount when the invisible slider is dragged.
        useTemplate: (create) - Forces the command to use a command template other than the current one.
        value: (create, edit, query) - Value of the field.

    Create a scroll bar control that accepts only float values and is bound by a minimum and maximum value.  The scroll bar displays a marker indicating the current value of the scroll bar relative to its minimum and maximum values.  Click and drag the marker or on the scroll bar itself to change the current value.

    Args:
        annotation: (create, edit, query) - Annotate the control with an extra string value.
        backgroundColor: (create, edit, query) - The background color of the control. The arguments correspond to the red, green, and blue color components. Each component ranges in value from 0.0 to 1.0. When setting backgroundColor, the background is automatically enabled, unless enableBackground is also specified with a false value.
        changeCommand: (create, edit) - Command executed when the value changes.  This command is not invoked when the value changes via the -v/value flag.
        defineTemplate: (create) - Puts the command in a mode where any other flags and arguments are parsed and added to the command template specified in the argument. They will be used as default arguments in any subsequent invocations of the command when templateName is set as the current template.
        docTag: (create, edit, query) - Add a documentation flag to the control.  The documentation flag has a directory structure. (e.g., -dt render/multiLister/createNode/material)
        dragCallback: (create, edit) - Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:  global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods)  The proc returns a string array that is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type.  Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers CTRL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTRL, 3 == CTRL + SHIFT.  In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form:  def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ):  The values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above.  The other way to specify the callback in Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys "dragControl", "x", "y", "modifiers".  The "dragControl" value is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be "print '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'")
        dragCommand: (create, edit) - Command executed when the value changes by dragging the scroll bar's value marker.
        dropCallback: (create, edit) - Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:  global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int $y, int $type)  The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback. $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link.  In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form:  def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ):  The values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above.  The other way to specify the callback in Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys "dragControl", "dropControl", "messages", "x", "y", "type".  The "dragControl" value is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be "print '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'")
        enable: (create, edit, query) - The enable state of the control.  By default, this flag is set to true and the control is enabled.  Specify false and the control will appear dimmed or greyed-out indicating it is disabled.
        enableBackground: (create, edit, query) - Enables the background color of the control.
        enableKeyboardFocus: (create, edit, query) - If enabled, the user can navigate to the control with the tab key and select values with the keyboard or mouse. This flag would typically be used to turn off focus support from controls that get it by default, like Edit and List controls. If disabled, text in text fields can still be selected with the mouse but cannot be copied (except on Linux when "Middle Click Paste" is enabled).
        exists: (create) - Returns whether the specified object exists or not. Other flags are ignored.
        fullPathName: (query) - Return the full path name of the widget, which includes all the parents.
        height: (create, edit, query) - The height of the control.  The control will attempt to be this size if it is not overruled by parent layout conditions.
        highlightColor: (create, edit, query) - The highlight color of the control. The arguments correspond to the red, green, and blue color components. Each component ranges in value from 0.0 to 1.0.
        horizontal: (create, query) - Orientation of the slider.  This flag is true by default, which corresponds to a horizontally oriented slider.
        isObscured: (query) - Return whether the control can actually be seen by the user. The control will be obscured if its state is invisible, if it is blocked (entirely or partially) by some other control, if it or a parent layout is unmanaged, or if the control's window is invisible or iconified.
        largeStep: (create, edit, query) - Larger increment for the scroll bar, ie. the increment used when the press is between the arrow button and the thumb.
        manage: (create, edit, query) - Manage state of the control.  An unmanaged control is not visible, nor does it take up any screen real estate.  All controls are created managed by default.
        maxValue: (create, edit, query) - Upper limit of the scroll bar.
        minValue: (create, edit, query) - Lower limit of the scroll bar.
        noBackground: (create, edit) - Clear/reset the control's background. Passing true means the background should not be drawn at all, false means the background should be drawn.  The state of this flag is inherited by children of this control.
        numberOfPopupMenus: (query) - Return the number of popup menus attached to this control.

The control will be obscured if its state is invisible, if it is blocked (entirely or partially) by some other control, if it or a parent layout is unmanaged, or if the control's window is invisible or iconified.
        manage: (create, edit, query) - Manage state of the control.  An unmanaged control is not visible, nor does it take up any screen real estate.  All controls are created managed by default.
        maximum: (create, edit, query) - Maximum limit of the slider. The default value is 10.0. The maximum value occurs at the top(right) end of the slider unless -polarity was specified. Note: you cannot set the maximum value greater than or equal to the current minimum.
        minimum: (create, edit, query) - Minimum limit of the slider. The default value is 0.0. The minimum value occurs at the bottom end of the slider unless -polarity was specified. Note: you cannot set the minimum value greater than or equal to the current maximum.
        noBackground: (create, edit) - Clear/reset the control's background. Passing true means the background should not be drawn at all, false means the background should be drawn.  The state of this flag is inherited by children of this control.
        numberOfPopupMenus: (query) - Return the number of popup menus attached to this control.
        parent: (create, query) - The parent layout for this control.
        polarity: (create, edit, query) - Specifies the polarity of the slider. If 0 (the default), the minimum value (specified by the -minimum flag) occurs at the bottom end of the slider and maximum at the top(right), with values increasing as the slider handles are moved towards the upper end of the slider. If the polarity is specified as 1, the reverse behaviour occurs, with the maximum occurring at the bottom end, the mimimum occuring at the top(right) end and values decreasing as the handles are moved towards the upper end.
        popupMenuArray: (query) - Return the names of all the popup menus attached to this control.
        positionControl1: (create, edit) - Set the name of the control (if any) which is associated with handle 1 of this slider. The control must be a "floatField". The control always displays the value of the handle, and is updated as the handle moves.
        positionControl2: (create, edit) - Set the name of the control (if any) which is associated with handle 2 of this slider. The control must be a "floatField". The control always displays the value of the handle, and is updated as the handle moves.
        preventOverride: (create, edit, query) - If true, this flag prevents overriding the control's attribute via the control's right mouse button menu.
        statusBarMessage: (create, edit) - Extra string to display in the status bar when the mouse is over the control.
        useTemplate: (create) - Forces the command to use a command template other than the current one.
        value1: (create, edit, query) - Value of handle 1. To ensure that handle 1 stays at or below handle 2, an error will occur if the value specified is too large. If you wish to set both handles simultaneously, use the -values flag.
        value2: (create, edit, query) - Value of handle 2. To ensure that handle 2 stays at or above handle 2, an error will occur if the value specified is too large. If you wish to set both handles simultaneously, use the -values flag.
        values: (create, edit) - Sets the value for handles 1 and 2 simulteneously. The first argument is applied to handle 1 and must be less than or equal to the second (handle 2) argument or an error will be issued.
        visible: (create, edit, query) - The visible state of the control.  A control is created visible by default.  Note that a control's actual appearance is also dependent on the visible state of its parent layout(s).
        visibleChangeCommand: (create, edit, query) - Command that gets executed when visible state of the control changes.
        width: (create, edit, query) - The width of the control.  The control will attempt to be this size if it is not overruled by parent layout conditions.

        docTag: (create, edit, query) - Add a documentation flag to the control.  The documentation flag has a directory structure. (e.g., -dt render/multiLister/createNode/material)
        dragCallback: (create, edit) - Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:  global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods)  The proc returns a string array that is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type.  Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers CTRL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTRL, 3 == CTRL + SHIFT.  In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form:  def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ):  The values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above.  The other way to specify the callback in Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys "dragControl", "x", "y", "modifiers".  The "dragControl" value is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be "print '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'")
        dragCommand: (create, edit) - Command string executed repeatedly during a drag of the slider.
        dropCallback: (create, edit) - Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:  global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int $y, int $type)  The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback. $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link.  In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form:  def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ):  The values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above.  The other way to specify the callback in Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys "dragControl", "dropControl", "messages", "x", "y", "type".  The "dragControl" value is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be "print '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'")
        enable: (create, edit, query) - The enable state of the control.  By default, this flag is set to true and the control is enabled.  Specify false and the control will appear dimmed or greyed-out indicating it is disabled.
        enableBackground: (create, edit, query) - Enables the background color of the control.
        enableKeyboardFocus: (create, edit, query) - If enabled, the user can navigate to the control with the tab key and select values with the keyboard or mouse. This flag would typically be used to turn off focus support from controls that get it by default, like Edit and List controls. If disabled, text in text fields can still be selected with the mouse but cannot be copied (except on Linux when "Middle Click Paste" is enabled).
        exists: (create) - Returns whether the specified object exists or not. Other flags are ignored.
        extraLabel: (create, edit, query) - If present on creation this specifies that there will be an extra label appearing after the slider.  Sets the string to be the text for the extra label.
        field: (create) - Indicates whether the group will have an editable float field present that reflects the value of the slider.
        fieldMaxValue: (create, edit, query) - Maximum value that may be entered in the field.  This value may be set to any value greater than the -max/maxValue flag.  By default, it is equal to the -max/maxValue flag.
        fieldMinValue: (create, edit, query) - Minimum value that may be entered in the field.  This value may be set to any value less than the -min/minValue flag.  By default, it is equal to the -min/minValue flag.
        fieldStep: (create, edit, query) - Increment for the field.
        fullPathName: (query) - Return the full path name of the widget, which includes all the parents.
        height: (create, edit, query) - The height of the control.  The control will attempt to be this size if it is not overruled by parent layout conditions.
        highlightColor: (create, edit, query) - The highlight color of the control. The arguments correspond to the red, green, and blue color components. Each component ranges in value from 0.0 to 1.0.
        image: (create, edit, query) - Image displayed on the symbol button.
        isObscured: (query) - Return whether the control can actually be seen by the user. The control will be obscured if its state is invisible, if it is blocked (entirely or partially) by some other control, if it or a parent layout is unmanaged, or if the control's window is invisible or iconified.
        label: (create, edit, query) - If present on creation the group will have static text.
        manage: (create, edit, query) - Manage state of the control.  An unmanaged control is not visible, nor does it take up any screen real estate.  All controls are created managed by default.
        maxValue: (create, edit, query) - Maximum value for both the slider and the field.
        minValue: (create, edit, query) - Minimum value for both the slider and the field.
        noBackground: (create, edit) - Clear/reset the control's background. Passing true means the background should not be drawn at all, false means the background should be drawn.  The state of this flag is inherited by children of this control.
        numberOfPopupMenus: (query) - Return the number of popup menus attached to this control.
        parent: (create, query) - The parent layout for this control.
        popupMenuArray: (query) - Return the names of all the popup menus attached to this control.

        statusBarMessage: (create, edit) - Extra string to display in the status bar when the mouse is over the control.
        step: (create, edit, query) - Increment for both the slider and field.
        symbolButtonCommand: (create, edit) - Command string executed when the symbol button is pressed.
        symbolButtonDisplay: (create, edit, query) - Visibility of the symbol button.
        useTemplate: (create) - Forces the command to use a command template other than the current one.
        value: (create, edit, query) - Value of the group.
        visible: (create, edit, query) - The visible state of the control.  A control is created visible by default.  Note that a control's actual appearance is also dependent on the visible state of its parent layout(s).
        visibleChangeCommand: (create, edit, query) - Command that gets executed when visible state of the control changes.

        docTag: (create, edit, query) - Add a documentation flag to the control.  The documentation flag has a directory structure. (e.g., -dt render/multiLister/createNode/material)
        dragCallback: (create, edit) - Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:  global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods)  The proc returns a string array that is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type.  Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers CTRL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTRL, 3 == CTRL + SHIFT.  In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form:  def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ):  The values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above.  The other way to specify the callback in Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys "dragControl", "x", "y", "modifiers".  The "dragControl" value is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be "print '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'")
        dragCommand: (create, edit) - Command string executed repeatedly during a drag of the slider.
        dropCallback: (create, edit) - Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:  global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int $y, int $type)  The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback. $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link.  In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form:  def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ):  The values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above.  The other way to specify the callback in Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys "dragControl", "dropControl", "messages", "x", "y", "type".  The "dragControl" value is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be "print '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'")
        enable: (create, edit, query) - The enable state of the control.  By default, this flag is set to true and the control is enabled.  Specify false and the control will appear dimmed or greyed-out indicating it is disabled.
        enableBackground: (create, edit, query) - Enables the background color of the control.
        enableKeyboardFocus: (create, edit, query) - If enabled, the user can navigate to the control with the tab key and select values with the keyboard or mouse. This flag would typically be used to turn off focus support from controls that get it by default, like Edit and List controls. If disabled, text in text fields can still be selected with the mouse but cannot be copied (except on Linux when "Middle Click Paste" is enabled).
        exists: (create) - Returns whether the specified object exists or not. Other flags are ignored.
        extraLabel: (create, edit, query) - If present on creation this specifies that there will be an extra label appearing after the slider.  Sets the string to be the text for the extra label.
        field: (create) - Indicates whether the group will have an editable float field present that reflects the value of the slider.
        fieldMaxValue: (create, edit, query) - Maximum value that may be entered in the field.  This value may be set to any value greater than the -max/maxValue flag.  By default, it is equal to the -max/maxValue flag.
        fieldMinValue: (create, edit, query) - Minimum value that may be entered in the field.  This value may be set to any value less than the -min/minValue flag.  By default, it is equal to the -min/minValue flag.
        fieldStep: (create, edit, query) - Increment for the field.
        fullPathName: (query) - Return the full path name of the widget, which includes all the parents.
        height: (create, edit, query) - The height of the control.  The control will attempt to be this size if it is not overruled by parent layout conditions.
        highlightColor: (create, edit, query) - The highlight color of the control. The arguments correspond to the red, green, and blue color components. Each component ranges in value from 0.0 to 1.0.
        isObscured: (query) - Return whether the control can actually be seen by the user. The control will be obscured if its state is invisible, if it is blocked (entirely or partially) by some other control, if it or a parent layout is unmanaged, or if the control's window is invisible or iconified.
        label: (create, edit, query) - If present on creation the group will have static text.
        manage: (create, edit, query) - Manage state of the control.  An unmanaged control is not visible, nor does it take up any screen real estate.  All controls are created managed by default.
        maxValue: (create, edit, query) - Maximum value for both the slider and the field.
        minValue: (create, edit, query) - Minimum value for both the slider and the field.
        noBackground: (create, edit) - Clear/reset the control's background. Passing true means the background should not be drawn at all, false means the background should be drawn.  The state of this flag is inherited by children of this control.
        numberOfPopupMenus: (query) - Return the number of popup menus attached to this control.
        parent: (create, query) - The parent layout for this control.
        popupMenuArray: (query) - Return the names of all the popup menus attached to this control.
        precision: (create, edit) - Number of digits to the right of the decimal.
        preventOverride: (create, edit, query) - If true, this flag prevents overriding the control's attribute via the control's right mouse button menu.
        rowAttach: (create, edit, multiuse) - Arguments are : column, attachment type, offset. Possible attachments are: top | bottom | both. Specifies attachment types and offsets for the entire row.
        sliderStep: (create, edit, query) - The slider step value represents the amount the value will increase or decrease when you click either side of the slider.
        statusBarMessage: (create, edit) - Extra string to display in the status bar when the mouse is over the control.
        step: (create, edit, query) - Increment for both the slider and field.
        useTemplate: (create) - Forces the command to use a command template other than the current one.
        value: (create, edit, query) - Value of the group.
        visible: (create, edit, query) - The visible state of the control.  A control is created visible by default.  Note that a control's actual appearance is also dependent on the visible state of its parent layout(s).
        visibleChangeCommand: (create, edit, query) - Command that gets executed when visible state of the control changes.
        width: (create, edit, query) - The width of the control.  The control will attempt to be this size if it is not overruled by parent layout conditions.

The MEL version of the callback is of the form:  global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int $y, int $type)  The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback. $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link.  In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form:  def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ):  The values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above.  The other way to specify the callback in Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys "dragControl", "dropControl", "messages", "x", "y", "type".  The "dragControl" value is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be "print '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'")
        enable: (create, edit, query) - The enable state of the control.  By default, this flag is set to true and the control is enabled.  Specify false and the control will appear dimmed or greyed-out indicating it is disabled.
        enableBackground: (create, edit, query) - Enables the background color of the control.
        enableKeyboardFocus: (create, edit, query) - If enabled, the user can navigate to the control with the tab key and select values with the keyboard or mouse. This flag would typically be used to turn off focus support from controls that get it by default, like Edit and List controls. If disabled, text in text fields can still be selected with the mouse but cannot be copied (except on Linux when "Middle Click Paste" is enabled).
        exists: (create) - Returns whether the specified object exists or not. Other flags are ignored.
        fullPathName: (query) - Return the full path name of the widget, which includes all the parents.
        height: (create, edit, query) - The height of the control.  The control will attempt to be this size if it is not overruled by parent layout conditions.
        highlightColor: (create, edit, query) - The highlight color of the control. The arguments correspond to the red, green, and blue color components. Each component ranges in value from 0.0 to 1.0.
        isObscured: (query) - Return whether the control can actually be seen by the user. The control will be obscured if its state is invisible, if it is blocked (entirely or partially) by some other control, if it or a parent layout is unmanaged, or if the control's window is invisible or iconified.
        manage: (create, edit, query) - Manage state of the control.  An unmanaged control is not visible, nor does it take up any screen real estate.  All controls are created managed by default.
        noBackground: (create, edit) - Clear/reset the control's background. Passing true means the background should not be drawn at all, false means the background should be drawn.  The state of this flag is inherited by children of this control.
        numberOfChildren: (query) - Returns in an int the number of immediate children of the layout.
        numberOfDivisions: (create, edit, query) - Specify the number of horizontal and vertical divisions across the form. Value must be greater than 0.
        numberOfPopupMenus: (query) - Return the number of popup menus attached to this control.
        parent: (create, query) - The parent layout for this control.
        popupMenuArray: (query) - Return the names of all the popup menus attached to this control.
        preventOverride: (create, edit, query) - If true, this flag prevents overriding the control's attribute via the control's right mouse button menu.
        statusBarMessage: (create, edit) - Extra string to display in the status bar when the mouse is over the control.
        useTemplate: (create) - Forces the command to use a command template other than the current one.
        visible: (create, edit, query) - The visible state of the control.  A control is created visible by default.  Note that a control's actual appearance is also dependent on the visible state of its parent layout(s).
        visibleChangeCommand: (create, edit, query) - Command that gets executed when visible state of the control changes.
        width: (create, edit, query) - The width of the control.  The control will attempt to be this size if it is not overruled by parent layout conditions.

    This command creates frame layout control. A frame layout may draw a border around its child controls as well as a display a title. Frame layouts may also be collapsable. Collapsing a frame layout will make the child of the frame layout invisible and shrink the frame layout size. The frame layout may then be expanded to make its child visible. Note that the frame layout may have only one child control.  If you wish to have more than one child inside a frame layout then you must use some other control layout as the immediate child of the frame layout.

    Args:
        annotation: (create, edit, query) - Annotate the control with an extra string value.
        backgroundColor: (create, edit, query) - The background color of the control. The arguments correspond to the red, green, and blue color components. Each component ranges in value from 0.0 to 1.0. When setting backgroundColor, the background is automatically enabled, unless enableBackground is also specified with a false value.
        backgroundShade: (create, edit, query) - Controls whether the background of the frame layout draws with a shaded effect. It is turned off by default.
        borderStyle: (create, edit, query) - This flag is obsolete. The border style is no longer supported. Using this flag will return a warning.
        borderVisible: (create, edit, query) - Visibility of the border.
        childArray: (query) - Returns a string array of the names of the layout's immediate children.
        collapsable: (create, edit, query) - Collapsibility of the frame layout.
        collapse: (create, edit, query) - Collapse state of the frame layout.
        collapseCommand: (create, edit) - Command executed after the frame is collapsed.
        defineTemplate: (create) - Puts the command in a mode where any other flags and arguments are parsed and added to the command template specified in the argument. They will be used as default arguments in any subsequent invocations of the command when templateName is set as the current template.
        docTag: (create, edit, query) - Add a documentation flag to the control.  The documentation flag has a directory structure. (e.g., -dt render/multiLister/createNode/material)
        dragCallback: (create, edit) - Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:  global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods)  The proc returns a string array that is transferred to the drop site.

True causes updates to only dispatch after releasing the mouse button after editing. False (the default) causes updates to dispatch interactively during editing (e.g. while moving ramp curve points). Note that the global update mode, if set to "on release" can disable the effect of this option.
        selectedColorControl: (create, edit) - Specifies the name of a color control to edit the selected color.
        selectedInterpControl: (create, edit) - Specifies the name of an enum control to edit the selected interpolation.
        selectedPositionControl: (create, edit) - Specifies the name of a float slider to edit the selected position.
        staticNumberOfControls: (create, edit, query) - When 'true', this flag disables the creation/deletion of ramp entries (control points) via ramp widget interaction. Default is false.
        staticPositions: (create, edit, query) - When 'true', this flag disables the interactive modification of ramp entry positions. Default is false.
        statusBarMessage: (create, edit) - Extra string to display in the status bar when the mouse is over the control.
        upperLimitControl: (create, edit, query) - Specify the name of a text control which is updated with the current upper display limit for the ramp. This option is only effective when adaptiveScaling is specified.
        useTemplate: (create) - Forces the command to use a command template other than the current one.
        verticalLayout: (create, edit, query) - When 'true', this makes the control orient vertically rather than horizontally. The default is `false` or horizontal.
        visible: (create, edit, query) - The visible state of the control.  A control is created visible by default.  Note that a control's actual appearance is also dependent on the visible state of its parent layout(s).
        visibleChangeCommand: (create, edit, query) - Command that gets executed when visible state of the control changes.
        width: (create, edit, query) - The width of the control.  The control will attempt to be this size if it is not overruled by parent layout conditions.

    This command creates a control for editing a ramp (2D control curve). The control attaches to an optionVar used to store and retrieve the encoded gradient control points stored in a string.

    Args:
        annotation: (create, edit, query) - Annotate the control with an extra string value.
        asString: (edit, query) - Used to query and set the value of the ramp as a string of comma separated values
        backgroundColor: (create, edit, query) - The background color of the control. The arguments correspond to the red, green, and blue color components. Each component ranges in value from 0.0 to 1.0. When setting backgroundColor, the background is automatically enabled, unless enableBackground is also specified with a false value.
        changeCommand: (edit) - Specifies a command to be executed whenever the value of this ramp is modified. This option should not be used when specifying an optionVar.
        currentKey: (create, edit, query) - Returns the index of the currently selected key.
        currentKeyChanged: (edit) - Specifies a command to be executed whenever the selected key changes.
        currentKeyColorValue: (edit, query) - Get or set the color of the currently selected key. Only useful if the ramp is set to be a color ramp.
        currentKeyCurveValue: (edit, query) - Get or set the value of the currently selected key. Only useful if the ramp is set to be a curve ramp.
        currentKeyInterpValue: (edit, query) - Get or set the interpolation value for the current key.
        defineTemplate: (create) - Puts the command in a mode where any other flags and arguments are parsed and added to the command template specified in the argument. They will be used as default arguments in any subsequent invocations of the command when templateName is set as the current template.
        docTag: (create, edit, query) - Add a documentation flag to the control.  The documentation flag has a directory structure. (e.g., -dt render/multiLister/createNode/material)
        dragCallback: (create, edit) - Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:  global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods)  The proc returns a string array that is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type.  Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers CTRL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTRL, 3 == CTRL + SHIFT.  In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form:  def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ):  The values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above.  The other way to specify the callback in Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys "dragControl", "x", "y", "modifiers".  The "dragControl" value is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be "print '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'")
        dragCommand: (edit) - Specifies a command to be executed while the ramp is being modified.
        dropCallback: (create, edit) - Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:  global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int $y, int $type)  The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback. $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link.  In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form:  def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ):  The values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above.  The other way to specify the callback in Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys "dragControl", "dropControl", "messages", "x", "y", "type".  The "dragControl" value is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be "print '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'")
        enable: (create, edit, query) - The enable state of the control.  By default, this flag is set to true and the control is enabled.  Specify false and the control will appear dimmed or greyed-out indicating it is disabled.
        enableBackground: (create, edit, query) - Enables the background color of the control.
        enableKeyboardFocus: (create, edit, query) - If enabled, the user can navigate to the control with the tab key and select values with the keyboard or mouse. This flag would typically be used to turn off focus support from controls that get it by default, like Edit and List controls. If disabled, text in text fields can still be selected with the mouse but cannot be copied (except on Linux when "Middle Click Paste" is enabled).
        exists: (create) - Returns whether the specified object exists or not. Other flags are ignored.
        fullPathName: (query) - Return the full path name of the widget, which includes all the parents.
        height: (create, edit, query) - The height of the control.  The control will attempt to be this size if it is not overruled by parent layout conditions.
        highlightColor: (create, edit, query) - The highlight color of the control. The arguments correspond to the red, green, and blue color components. Each component ranges in value from 0.0 to 1.0.
        highlightMode: (create, edit, query) - Specifies when the ramp should be highlighted. Only applies to curves. Possible values are "off", "hover" and "always". Default is "off".
        isObscured: (query) - Return whether the control can actually be seen by the user. The control will be obscured if its state is invisible, if it is blocked (entirely or partially) by some other control, if it or a parent layout is unmanaged, or if the control's window is invisible or iconified.
        manage: (create, edit, query) - Manage state of the control.  An unmanaged control is not visible, nor does it take up any screen real estate.  All controls are created managed by default.
        noBackground: (create, edit) - Clear/reset the control's background. Passing true means the background should not be drawn at all, false means the background should be drawn.  The state of this flag is inherited by children of this control.
        numberOfPopupMenus: (query) - Return the number of popup menus attached to this control.
        optionVar: (create, edit, query) - Specifies the name of the option var used to store and retrieve the string value capturing the curve.
        parent: (create, query) - The parent layout for this control.
        popupMenuArray: (query) - Return the names of all the popup menus attached to this control.
        preventOverride: (create, edit, query) - If true, this flag prevents overriding the control's attribute via the control's right mouse button menu.
        rampAsColor: (create, edit, query) - Sets whether the ramp should be viewed as a colour ramp or as a curve.  Default is as a curve.
        readOnly: (create, edit, query) - Specifies if the ramp is read only or not. If true, the ramp can't be edited and control points will be hidden.
        statusBarMessage: (create, edit) - Extra string to display in the status bar when the mouse is over the control.
        useTemplate: (create) - Forces the command to use a command template other than the current one.
        valueAtPoint: (query) - Used during query to specify the point at which to query the curve.       In query mode, this flag needs a value.
        visible: (create, edit, query) - The visible state of the control.  A control is created visible by default.  Note that a control's actual appearance is also dependent on the visible state of its parent layout(s).
        visibleChangeCommand: (create, edit, query) - Command that gets executed when visible state of the control changes.
        width: (create, edit, query) - The width of the control.  The control will attempt to be this size if it is not overruled by parent layout conditions.

    This command creates a Heads-up Display (HUD) object which is placed in a 2D inactive overlay plane on the 3D viewport. It is to be used to provide hands-on information designated by a user script. The text string displayed on the viewport is formatted using the various flags of this command.

    Args:
        allDescendants: (create, edit) - This flag can only be used in conjunction with the -ac/attributeChange flag. If it is specified, and the HUD is attached to a compound or multi attribute, then the HUD command will run due to changes to the specified attribute as well as changes to its descendants.
        allowOverlap: (create, edit, query) - Sets the Heads-Up Display to be visible regardless of overlapping section widths/limitations (see -s/section flag description for more details).
        attachToRefresh: (create, edit, query) - Attaches the command to the refresh process. The script is then run each time an idle refresh is run and updates directly following it.
        attributeChange: (create, edit) - Runs the command when the named attribute changes value. The string must identify both the dependency node and the particular attribute. If the dependency node is deleted, this HUD is removed (even if the deletion is undoable).
        block: (create, edit, query) - Denotes the individual block that the HUD will reside in, within a section. Each section is composed of a single column of blocks. The total number of blocks contained within each section is variable.  The number of blocks that will be visible within each section is dependent on the size of blocks contained in each section and the current size of the window. Blocks begin enumerating from 0 and flexibly increase based on need.  The resultant output string of each HUD is formatted within each block, using parameters defined by the formatting flags listed below (eg. justify, padding, labelWidth and dataWidth). The layout is shown in the following diagram:   __________________________________________ |     |     |        |         |     |     | |  P  |  J  |   LW   |   DWX   |  J  |  P  | |_____|_____|________|_________|_____|_____| P = Sub-block of width, padding J = Justification of the entire block LW = Sub-block of width, labelWidth DWX = X number of sub-blocks of width, dataWidth, for X data elements.   Block Layout  The above diagram shows the layout of each block. The widths: padding, labelWidth and dataWidth are defined by their respective flags. To elaborate on the layout of the blocks, First the padding of the block is calculated. Then the two main sub-blocks (LW and DWX) in the above diagram, are justified and positioned together between the left and right margins of the block. The widths of the main sub-blocks are not variable based on it's contents. The only sub-block in the above diagram which is unique is the DWX sub-block which actually represents X number of sub-blocks, where X is the number of data elements returned by the command.  Block Positioning  Blocks on the top section begin from the top edge of the main viewport, while the bottom section begins from the bottom edge. Blocks are dynamically removed from visibility from the midpoint of the viewport. So, a relatively large block number will not draw to the viewport.  Lastly, there can be at most one HUD occupying a block at any time. Trying to position a HUD in an occupied block will result in an error. Keep this in mind when positioning the HUD.
        blockAlignment: (create, edit, query) - Specifies the alignment of the block within its respective column. Available alignments are: "center", "left" and "right". The default alignment is "left".
        blockSize: (create, edit, query) - Sets the height of each block. Available heights are: small, medium and large. In pixel measurements, each corresponds to a 20, 35 or 50 pixel height, respectively.
        command: (create, edit, query) - Specifies the procedure or script to run, in order to obtain the desired information. This must return a value or an array of values. A warning will be displayed if the command does not return a value. This flag MUST always be accompanied by a trigger flag (eg. a condition flag, an event flag, an attachToRefresh flag, etc.).
        conditionChange: (create, edit) - A trigger which runs the command (to sample the data), when the named condition changes. The named condition must be pre-defined or a user defined boolean. To get a list of what conditions exist, use the -lc/listConditions flag.
        conditionFalse: (create, edit) - A trigger which runs the command (to sample the data), when the named condition becomes false. The named condition must be pre-defined or a user defined boolean. To get a list of what conditions exist, use the -lc/listConditions flag.
        conditionTrue: (create, edit) - A trigger which runs the command (to sample the data), when the named condition becomes true. The named condition must be pre-defined or a user defined boolean. To get a list of what conditions exist, use the -lc/listConditions flag.
        connectionChange: (create, edit) - Runs the command when the named attribute changes its connectivity. The string must identify both the dependency node and the particular attribute. If the dependency node is deleted, this HUD is removed (even if the deletion is undoable).
        dataAlignment: (create, edit, query) - Specifies the alignment of the data blocks and the data text, within a HUD block. Available alignments are: "left" and "right". The default alignment is "left".
        dataFontSize: (create, edit, query) - Sets the font size of the returned data. Available sizes are: small and large.
        dataWidth: (create, edit, query) - Specifies the pixel width of the virtual "textbox" which will hold a data value. For commands which return more than one value (ie. arrays), one of these "textboxes" will be created for each data element, each with this specified width. If the width of the data value exceeds the width of the "textbox", the data value will be truncated to fit within the dimensions of the "textbox." (To see a layout of a block, see the description of the -block flag.)
        decimalPrecision: (create, edit, query) - Sets the decimal precision of any floating point value returned by the command. The valid range of precision values are 1 to 8.
        disregardIndex: (create, edit) - This flag can only be used in conjunction with the -ac/attributeChange flag. If it is specified, and the HUD is attached to a multi (indexed) attribute, then the HUD command will run no matter which attribute in the multi changes.
        event: (create, edit) - Runs the command when the named event occurs. The named event, must be a pre-defined Maya event. To get a list of what events exist, use the -le/listEvents flag.
        exists: (create, query) - This flag returns whether the given object exists in the Heads-Up Display layout. An object name must be supplied with this command. This flag cannot be combined with any other flag.
        getOption: (query) - This flag will return the value of the option specified by the string. See setOption for a list of options 			In query mode, this flag needs a value.
        gridColor: (create, edit, query) - This flag specifies a color for the grid lines using the inactive color palette. Specifying an index number between 1 to 23 will select the corresponding color in the palette.
        label: (create, edit, query) - Text string that appears to the left of the desired information.
        labelFontSize: (create, edit, query) - Sets the font size of the label. Available sizes are: small and large.
        labelWidth: (create, edit, query) - Specifies the pixel width of the virtual "textbox" which will hold the label. The contents of this "textbox" will be left justified. If the width of the actual label exceeds the width of the "textbox," the label will be truncated to fit within the dimensions of the "textbox." (To see a layout of a block, see the description of the -block flag.)
        lastOccupiedBlock: (create) - Returns the block number of the last occupied block in a given section.
        layoutVisibility: (create, edit, query) - Sets the visibility of Heads-Up Display layout on and off. This does not modify individual visibilities of heads-up displays, but turns off the layout so that no heads-up displays will draw to screen. Personalized settings for the visibilities of HUDs are kept safe. This flag can only be used by itself, excepting edit and query.
        listConditions: (create, query) - This flag will return a string array containing all names of the available conditions.
        listEvents: (create, query) - This flag will return a string array containing all names of the available events.
        listHeadsUpDisplays: (create, query) - This flag will return a string array containing all names of existing HUDs.
        listNodeChanges: (create, query) - This flag will return a string array containing all names of the available node changes.
        listPresets: (create, query) - This flag will return a string array containing all names of the available preset HUDs.
        name: (edit) - This flag only permits the EDITING of the name of the Heads-Up Display.
        nextFreeBlock: (create) - Returns the block number of the next free block in a given section.
        nodeChanges: (create, edit, multiuse, query) - Works only with selection based triggers (ie. "SelectionChanged" or "SomethingSelected"), otherwise this flag is ignored. This flag attaches the HUD script to execute on specific node changes of any selected node. This flag is used to set a nodeChange. In order to reset a nodeChange, use the -rnc/resetNodeChanges flag. To view a list of all available node changes, use the -lnc/listNodeChanges flag. The following is a list of available node changes and their function:  attributeChange:  The script will be sensitive to any attribute changes in the currently                   selected nodes.  connectionChange: The script will be sensitive to any connection changes in the currently                   selected nodes.  instanceChange:   The script will be sensitive to any changes to an instance in the                   currently selected nodes.   On query mode, this flag will return the values of all nodeChanges in pairs of values (the name of the nodeChange followed by its value).  WARNING: (Performance Warning)          Attaching a nodeChange trigger to a selection based trigger can cause a large          performance drop, if the node change that is being watched is caused by the          HUD script itself.           With this said, an attempt should be made to keep the HUD command/script                  simple and limited to retrieving data. Changing an attribute, creating or                  modifying a connection or instance will all result in a performance drop.
        padding: (create, edit, query) - Specifies the width of both the left and right margins of a block. Default value is 15 pixels.
        preset: (create, edit, query) - This setting is used to select certain pre-defined HUDs, some of which retrieve specific data, that is unobtainable through normal MEL commands or scripts. This flag is mutually exclusive from the command and trigger flag combination. However, presets can work with all other headsUpDisplay attribute flags (ie. block alignment, label, dataFontSize, etc.), unless otherwise specified below. To obtain a list of available presets, use the -lp/listPresets flag on this command.  The following is a list of available presets and a description of each:  cameraNames This will return the camera name that the view is looking through, in the data block, for each view that the HUD is drawing to. polyVerts This will return three values in the data block, regarding the number of vertices that are visible by the camera.  1st Value: Represents the number of camera visible vertices, both active and inactive. 2nd Value: Represents the number of camera visible vertices, on active objects only. 3rd Value: Represents the number of camera visible vertices, that are active.  polyEdges This will return three values in the data block, regarding the number of edges that are visible by the camera. The order of these three values are similar to the polyVerts preset. polyFaces This will return three values in the data block, regarding the number of faces that are visible by the camera. The order of these three values are similar to the polyVerts preset. polyUVs This will return three values in the data block, regarding the number of UVs that are visible by the camera. The order of these three values are similar to the polyVerts preset. polyTriangles This will return three values in the data block, regarding the number of triangles that are visible by the camera. The order of these three values are similar to the polyVerts preset. materialLoadingCount This will return the material loading count. It updates on each refresh. textureLoadingCount This will return the texture loading count. It updates on each refresh. frameRate This will return a single string carrying both the frame rate and the "fps" string in the data block. It updates on each refresh. viewAxis This will draw the orientation of the grid axes within the HUD. It updates on each refresh. While this preset can take in all attribute flags, the only one which will have an effect are block attribute related flags (ie. block alignment and block size). The block dimensions of this preset are: blockSize - "large" and blockWidth - "50", which results in a 50x50 pixel region. distanceFromCamera This will return in the data block the distance from the view's camera to the centre of the bounding box containing the selected objects in the view.
        refresh: (create) - This flag forces the given Heads-Up Display element to refresh, updating the value displayed.  This flag cannot be combined with any other flag.
        remove: (create, edit) - This command will remove a given HUD object, given a specified HUD name. This flag will override all other flags and is mutually exclusive from the other remove flags.
        removeID: (create, edit) - This command will remove a given HUD object, given a specified HUD ID number assigned to it at creation time. This flag will override all other flags and is mutually exclusive from the other remove flags.
        removePosition: (create, edit) - This command will remove the contents of a specific block location in the HUD layout. This flag will override all other flags and is mutually exclusive from the other remove flags. Syntax for this flag is: -removePosition/rp [section] [block].
        resetNodeChanges: (edit, multiuse) - This flag will reset a specificied nodeChange back to false. This flag only operates under the edit flag. See the description for the -nc/nodeChanges flag for further details.
        scriptResult: (query) - This flag is only used in conjunction with the query flag. Calling a query on this flag returns the most recent result of the HUD.
        section: (create, edit, query) - Defines the section the HUD will appear in. There are 10 sections divided across the screen. Five columns and two rows make up the ten element matrix which divide the main viewport. Here is a visual layout of the sections.   ________________________ |    |    |    |    |    | |    |    |    |    |    | | 0  | 1  | 2  | 3  | 4  | |    |    |    |    |    | |____|____|____|____|____| |    |    |    |    |    | |    |    |    |    |    | | 5  | 6  | 7  | 8  | 9  | |    |    |    |    |    | |____|____|____|____|____| Each section is denoted by a number from 0 to 9 as illustrated above. For example, if the second column of the top row was desired, the section would be defined as: -sec 1  To prevent HUD objects from displaying over each other and causing a clutter of letters, each row has a defined visibility precedence, where each section would have a visibility priority level. Depending on each priority level, when the screen space begins to shrink to a point where the section widths of a given row begin to collide, the HUD automatically compensates for this by removing the sections of least priority. These sections are made invisible and a warning is issued to inform the user of the removal. This continues until only the section of highest priority remains.  For each row, the priorities are defined as follows. Using the top row as an example: Section 0, has the highest priority, followed by Section 4, making the outermost sections of highest priority. Next in the list is Section 2, and lastly Sections 1 and 3 are of the equal and least priority. This priority structure can be applied to the bottom row as well. The two outermost sections have the highest priority, followed by the middle section, and finally the remaining two sections are of lowest priority.  This means that as the viewport gradually decreases in width to the point where sections in the top row begin to overlap, sections 1 and 3 will be removed from view first, followed by section 2, and finally section 4. A similar note is provided below for the block layout.
        setOption: (edit) - This flag will edit the option specified by the first string. Current options are: smpPolyCount - "cage" or "smp" - in smooth mesh preview, determines the poly count display
        showGrid: (create, edit, query) - This flag will toggle the display of the grid lines of the HUD layout.
        visible: (create, edit, query) - Sets the visibility of the Heads-Up Display on and off.

    This command creates a help line where tool help/hints are shown.

    Args:
        annotation: (create, edit, query) - Annotate the control with an extra string value.
        backgroundColor: (create, edit, query) - The background color of the control. The arguments correspond to the red, green, and blue color components. Each component ranges in value from 0.0 to 1.0. When setting backgroundColor, the background is automatically enabled, unless enableBackground is also specified with a false value.
        defineTemplate: (create) - Puts the command in a mode where any other flags and arguments are parsed and added to the command template specified in the argument. They will be used as default arguments in any subsequent invocations of the command when templateName is set as the current template.
        docTag: (create, edit, query) - Add a documentation flag to the control.  The documentation flag has a directory structure. (e.g., -dt render/multiLister/createNode/material)
        dragCallback: (create, edit) - Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:  global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods)  The proc returns a string array that is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type.  Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers CTRL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTRL, 3 == CTRL + SHIFT.  In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form:  def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ):  The values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above.  The other way to specify the callback in Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys "dragControl", "x", "y", "modifiers".  The "dragControl" value is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be "print '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'")
        dropCallback: (create, edit) - Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:  global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int $y, int $type)  The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback. $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link.  In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form:  def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ):  The values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above.  The other way to specify the callback in Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys "dragControl", "dropControl", "messages", "x", "y", "type".  The "dragControl" value is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be "print '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'")
        enable: (create, edit, query) - The enable state of the control.  By default, this flag is set to true and the control is enabled.  Specify false and the control will appear dimmed or greyed-out indicating it is disabled.
        enableBackground: (create, edit, query) - Enables the background color of the control.
        enableKeyboardFocus: (create, edit, query) - If enabled, the user can navigate to the control with the tab key and select values with the keyboard or mouse. This flag would typically be used to turn off focus support from controls that get it by default, like Edit and List controls. If disabled, text in text fields can still be selected with the mouse but cannot be copied (except on Linux when "Middle Click Paste" is enabled).
        exists: (create) - Returns whether the specified object exists or not. Other flags are ignored.
        fullPathName: (query) - Return the full path name of the widget, which includes all the parents.
        height: (create, edit, query) - The height of the control.  The control will attempt to be this size if it is not overruled by parent layout conditions.
        highlightColor: (create, edit, query) - The highlight color of the control. The arguments correspond to the red, green, and blue color components. Each component ranges in value from 0.0 to 1.0.
        isObscured: (query) - Return whether the control can actually be seen by the user. The control will be obscured if its state is invisible, if it is blocked (entirely or partially) by some other control, if it or a parent layout is unmanaged, or if the control's window is invisible or iconified.
        manage: (create, edit, query) - Manage state of the control.  An unmanaged control is not visible, nor does it take up any screen real estate.  All controls are created managed by default.
        noBackground: (create, edit) - Clear/reset the control's background. Passing true means the background should not be drawn at all, false means the background should be drawn.  The state of this flag is inherited by children of this control.
        numberOfPopupMenus: (query) - Return the number of popup menus attached to this control.
        parent: (create, query) - The parent layout for this control.
        popupMenuArray: (query) - Return the names of all the popup menus attached to this control.
        preventOverride: (create, edit, query) - If true, this flag prevents overriding the control's attribute via the control's right mouse button menu.
        statusBarMessage: (create, edit) - Extra string to display in the status bar when the mouse is over the control.
        useTemplate: (create) - Forces the command to use a command template other than the current one.
        visible: (create, edit, query) - The visible state of the control.  A control is created visible by default.  Note that a control's actual appearance is also dependent on the visible state of its parent layout(s).
        visibleChangeCommand: (create, edit, query) - Command that gets executed when visible state of the control changes.
        width: (create, edit, query) - The width of the control.  The control will attempt to be this size if it is not overruled by parent layout conditions.

    Args:
        annotation: (create, edit, query) - Annotate the control with an extra string value.
        backgroundColor: (create, edit, query) - The background color of the control. The arguments correspond to the red, green, and blue color components. Each component ranges in value from 0.0 to 1.0. When setting backgroundColor, the background is automatically enabled, unless enableBackground is also specified with a false value.
        defineTemplate: (create) - Puts the command in a mode where any other flags and arguments are parsed and added to the command template specified in the argument. They will be used as default arguments in any subsequent invocations of the command when templateName is set as the current template.
        docTag: (create, edit, query) - Add a documentation flag to the control.  The documentation flag has a directory structure. (e.g., -dt render/multiLister/createNode/material)
        dragCallback: (create, edit) - Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:  global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods)  The proc returns a string array that is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type.  Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers CTRL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTRL, 3 == CTRL + SHIFT.  In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form:  def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ):  The values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above.  The other way to specify the callback in Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys "dragControl", "x", "y", "modifiers".  The "dragControl" value is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be "print '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'")
        dropCallback: (create, edit) - Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:  global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int $y, int $type)  The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback. $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link.  In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form:  def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ):  The values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above.  The other way to specify the callback in Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys "dragControl", "dropControl", "messages", "x", "y", "type".  The "dragControl" value is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be "print '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'")
        enable: (create, edit, query) - The enable state of the control.  By default, this flag is set to true and the control is enabled.  Specify false and the control will appear dimmed or greyed-out indicating it is disabled.
        enableBackground: (create, edit, query) - Enables the background color of the control.
        enableKeyboardFocus: (create, edit, query) - If enabled, the user can navigate to the control with the tab key and select values with the keyboard or mouse. This flag would typically be used to turn off focus support from controls that get it by default, like Edit and List controls. If disabled, text in text fields can still be selected with the mouse but cannot be copied (except on Linux when "Middle Click Paste" is enabled).
        exists: (create) - Returns whether the specified object exists or not. Other flags are ignored.
        fullPathName: (query) - Return the full path name of the widget, which includes all the parents.
        height: (create, edit, query) - The height of the control.  The control will attempt to be this size if it is not overruled by parent layout conditions.
        highlightColor: (create, edit, query) - The highlight color of the control. The arguments correspond to the red, green, and blue color components. Each component ranges in value from 0.0 to 1.0.
        isObscured: (query) - Return whether the control can actually be seen by the user. The control will be obscured if its state is invisible, if it is blocked (entirely or partially) by some other control, if it or a parent layout is unmanaged, or if the control's window is invisible or iconified.
        manage: (create, edit, query) - Manage state of the control.  An unmanaged control is not visible, nor does it take up any screen real estate.  All controls are created managed by default.
        noBackground: (create, edit) - Clear/reset the control's background. Passing true means the background should not be drawn at all, false means the background should be drawn.  The state of this flag is inherited by children of this control.
        numberOfPopupMenus: (query) - Return the number of popup menus attached to this control.
        parent: (create, query) - The parent layout for this control.
        popupMenuArray: (query) - Return the names of all the popup menus attached to this control.
        preventOverride: (create, edit, query) - If true, this flag prevents overriding the control's attribute via the control's right mouse button menu.
        statusBarMessage: (create, edit) - Extra string to display in the status bar when the mouse is over the control.
        useTemplate: (create) - Forces the command to use a command template other than the current one.
        visible: (create, edit, query) - The visible state of the control.  A control is created visible by default.  Note that a control's actual appearance is also dependent on the visible state of its parent layout(s).
        visibleChangeCommand: (create, edit, query) - Command that gets executed when visible state of the control changes.
        width: (create, edit, query) - The width of the control.  The control will attempt to be this size if it is not overruled by parent layout conditions.

It is to be used to provide hands-on interaction designated by a user script. The HUD button is derived from a generic HUD object and thus inherits a similar workflow.

    Args:
        allowOverlap: (create, edit, query) - Sets the Heads-Up Display to be visible regardless of overlapping section widths/limitations (see -s/section flag description for more details).
        block: (create, edit, query) - Denotes the individual block that the HUD will reside in, within a section. Each section is composed of a single column of blocks. The total number of blocks contained within each section is variable.  The number of blocks that will be visible within each section is dependent on the size of blocks contained in each section and the current size of the window. Blocks begin enumerating from 0 and flexibly increase based on need.  For HUD buttons, the format differs from that of the standard HUD. The layout using parameters defined by the formatting flags listed below (eg. justify, padding, buttonWidth) is shown below:   __________________________________ |     |     |          |     |     | |  P  |  J  |  Button  |  J  |  P  | |_____|_____|__________|_____|_____| P = Sub-block of width, padding J = Justification of the entire block Button = Sub-block of width, buttonWidth   Block Positioning  Blocks on the top section begin from the top edge of the main viewport, while the bottom section begins from the bottom edge. Blocks are dynamically removed from visibility from the midpoint of the viewport. So, a relatively large block number will not draw to the viewport.  Lastly, there can be at most one HUD occupying a block at any time. Trying to position a HUD in an occupied block will result in an error. Keep this in mind when positioning the HUD.
        blockAlignment: (create, edit, query) - Specifies the alignment of the block within its respective column. Available alignments are: "center", "left" and "right". The default alignment is "left".
        blockSize: (create, edit, query) - Sets the height of each block. Available heights are: small, medium and large. In pixel measurements, each corresponds to a 20, 35 or 50 pixel height, respectively.
        buttonShape: (create, edit, query) - Specifies the shape of the button. Available button shapes are: "rectangle" and "roundRectangle". The first will draw a rectangular button, while the latter is a rectangle with rounded edges.
        buttonWidth: (create, edit, query) - Specifies the width of the button.
        label: (create, edit, query) - Text label of the HUD button.
        labelFontSize: (create, edit, query) - Sets the font size of the label. Available sizes are: small and large.
        padding: (create, edit, query) - Specifies the width of both the left and right margins of a block. Default value is 15 pixels.
        pressCommand: (create, edit, query) - Specifies the procedure or script to run during a mouse click event.
        releaseCommand: (create, edit, query) - Specifies the procedure or script to run during a mouse release event.
        section: (create, edit, query) - Defines the section the HUD will appear in. There are 10 sections divided across the screen. Five columns and two rows make up the ten element matrix which divide the main viewport. Here is a visual layout of the sections.   ________________________ |    |    |    |    |    | |    |    |    |    |    | | 0  | 1  | 2  | 3  | 4  | |    |    |    |    |    | |____|____|____|____|____| |    |    |    |    |    | |    |    |    |    |    | | 5  | 6  | 7  | 8  | 9  | |    |    |    |    |    | |____|____|____|____|____| Each section is denoted by a number from 0 to 9 as illustrated above. For example, if the second column of the top row was desired, the section would be defined as: -sec 1  To prevent HUD objects from displaying over each other and causing a clutter of letters, each row has a defined visibility precedence, where each section would have a visibility priority level. Depending on each priority level, when the screen space begins to shrink to a point where the section widths of a given row begin to collide, the HUD automatically compensates for this by removing the sections of least priority. These sections are made invisible and a warning is issued to inform the user of the removal. This continues until only the section of highest priority remains.  For each row, the priorities are defined as follows. Using the top row as an example: Section 0, has the highest priority, followed by Section 4, making the outermost sections of highest priority. Next in the list is Section 2, and lastly Sections 1 and 3 are of the equal and least priority. This priority structure can be applied to the bottom row as well. The two outermost sections have the highest priority, followed by the middle section, and finally the remaining two sections are of lowest priority.  This means that as the viewport gradually decreases in width to the point where sections in the top row begin to overlap, sections 1 and 3 will be removed from view first, followed by section 2, and finally section 4. A similar note is provided below for the block layout.

The layout using parameters defined by the formatting flags listed below (eg. justify, padding, labelWidth, valueWidth) is shown below:   __________________________________________________________________ |     |     |        |            |      |             |     |     | |  P  |  J  |   LW   |   Slider   |  IP  | SliderValue |  J  |  P  | |_____|_____|________|____________|______|_____________|_____|_____| P = Sub-block of width, padding J = Justification of the entire block LW = Sub-block of width, labelWidth Slider = Length of the slider SliderValue = Sub-block of width, valueWidth IP = Internal padding   Block Positioning  Blocks on the top section begin from the top edge of the main viewport, while the bottom section begins from the bottom edge. Blocks are dynamically removed from visibility from the midpoint of the viewport. So, a relatively large block number will not draw to the viewport.  Lastly, there can be at most one HUD occupying a block at any time. Trying to position a HUD in an occupied block will result in an error. Keep this in mind when positioning the HUD.
        blockAlignment: (create, edit, query) - Specifies the alignment of the block within its respective column. Available alignments are: "center", "left" and "right". The default alignment is "left".
        blockSize: (create, edit, query) - Sets the height of each block. Available heights are: small, medium and large. In pixel measurements, each corresponds to a 20, 35 or 50 pixel height, respectively.
        decimalPrecision: (create, edit, query) - Sets the decimal precision of any floating point value returned by the command. The valid range of precision values are 1 to 8.
        dragCommand: (create, edit, query) - Specifies the procedure or script to run during a mouse drag event.
        internalPadding: (create, edit, query) - Specifies the amount of padding between the internal elements of the HUD. For the hudSlider, this represents the padding between the slider bar and the slider value. The default padding is 10.
        label: (create, edit, query) - Text label of the HUD.
        labelFontSize: (create, edit, query) - Sets the font size of the label. Available sizes are: small and large.
        labelWidth: (create, edit, query) - Specifies the pixel width of the virtual "textbox" which will hold the label. The contents of this "textbox" will be left justified. If the width of the actual label exceeds the width of the "textbox," the label will be truncated to fit within the dimensions of the "textbox." (To see a layout of a block, see the description of the -block flag.)
        maxValue: (create, edit, query) - Specify the maximum value of the slider. Note: Although this flag takes in a FLOAT as an argument, if the HUD type is "int", the value will be automatically converted internally to an integer.
        minValue: (create, edit, query) - Specify the minimum value of the slider. Note: Although this flag takes in a FLOAT as an argument, if the HUD type is "int", the value will be automatically converted internally to an integer.
        padding: (create, edit, query) - Specifies the width of both the left and right margins of a block. Default value is 15 pixels.
        pressCommand: (create, edit, query) - Specifies the procedure or script to run during a mouse click event.
        releaseCommand: (create, edit, query) - Specifies the procedure or script to run during a mouse release event.
        section: (create, edit, query) - Defines the section the HUD will appear in. There are 10 sections divided across the screen. Five columns and two rows make up the ten element matrix which divide the main viewport. Here is a visual layout of the sections.   ________________________ |    |    |    |    |    | |    |    |    |    |    | | 0  | 1  | 2  | 3  | 4  | |    |    |    |    |    | |____|____|____|____|____| |    |    |    |    |    | |    |    |    |    |    | | 5  | 6  | 7  | 8  | 9  | |    |    |    |    |    | |____|____|____|____|____| Each section is denoted by a number from 0 to 9 as illustrated above. For example, if the second column of the top row was desired, the section would be defined as: -sec 1  To prevent HUD objects from displaying over each other and causing a clutter of letters, each row has a defined visibility precedence, where each section would have a visibility priority level. Depending on each priority level, when the screen space begins to shrink to a point where the section widths of a given row begin to collide, the HUD automatically compensates for this by removing the sections of least priority. These sections are made invisible and a warning is issued to inform the user of the removal. This continues until only the section of highest priority remains.  For each row, the priorities are defined as follows. Using the top row as an example: Section 0, has the highest priority, followed by Section 4, making the outermost sections of highest priority. Next in the list is Section 2, and lastly Sections 1 and 3 are of the equal and least priority. This priority structure can be applied to the bottom row as well. The two outermost sections have the highest priority, followed by the middle section, and finally the remaining two sections are of lowest priority.  This means that as the viewport gradually decreases in width to the point where sections in the top row begin to overlap, sections 1 and 3 will be removed from view first, followed by section 2, and finally section 4. A similar note is provided below for the block layout.
        sliderIncrement: (create, edit, query) - Specify the number of increments along the slider. If not specified or set to 0 or less, the slider will be linearly even and continuous from minValue to maxValue. Note: Although this flag takes in a FLOAT as an argument, if the HUD type is "int", the value will be automatically converted internally to an integer.
        sliderLength: (create, edit, query) - Specifies the length of the slider in pixels.
        type: (create, edit, query) - Specify the numeric type of the HUD. Available types are: "float" and "int".
        value: (create, edit, query) - Set/Return the slider value if the HUD is a valid HUD slider. Note: Although this flag takes in a FLOAT as an argument, if the HUD type is "int", the value will be automatically converted internally to an integer.
        valueAlignment: (create, edit, query) - Specifies the alignment of the data blocks and the data text, within a HUD block. Available alignments are: "left" and "right". The default alignment is "left".
        valueFontSize: (create, edit, query) - Sets the font size of the slider value. Available sizes are: small and large.
        valueWidth: (create, edit, query) - Specifies the pixel width of the virtual "textbox" which will hold the slider value. (To see a layout of a block, see the description of the -block flag.)
        visible: (create, edit, query) - Sets the visibility of the Heads-Up Display on and off.

    This control supports up to 3 icon images and 4 different display styles.  The icon image displayed is the one that best fits the current size of the control given its current style.

    Args:
        align: (create, edit, query) - The label alignment.  Alignment values are "left", "right", and "center". By default, the label is aligned "center". Currently only available when -st/style is set to "iconAndTextCentered".
        annotation: (create, edit, query) - Annotate the control with an extra string value.
        backgroundColor: (create, edit, query) - The background color of the control. The arguments correspond to the red, green, and blue color components. Each component ranges in value from 0.0 to 1.0. When setting backgroundColor, the background is automatically enabled, unless enableBackground is also specified with a false value.
        command: (create, edit, query) - Command executed when the control is pressed.
        commandRepeatable: (create, edit, query) - Set if the MEL command specified in the command flag should be repeatable or not.  The "g" key, by default, is the shortcut to repeat the last executed command.
        defineTemplate: (create) - Puts the command in a mode where any other flags and arguments are parsed and added to the command template specified in the argument. They will be used as default arguments in any subsequent invocations of the command when templateName is set as the current template.
        disabledImage: (create, edit, query) - Image used when the button is disabled. Image size must be the same as the image specified with the i/image flag. This is a Windows only flag.
        docTag: (create, edit, query) - Add a documentation flag to the control.  The documentation flag has a directory structure. (e.g., -dt render/multiLister/createNode/material)
        doubleClickCommand: (create, edit, query) - Command executed when the control is double clicked.
        dragCallback: (create, edit) - Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:  global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods)  The proc returns a string array that is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type.  Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers CTRL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTRL, 3 == CTRL + SHIFT.  In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form:  def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ):  The values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above.  The other way to specify the callback in Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys "dragControl", "x", "y", "modifiers".  The "dragControl" value is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be "print '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'")
        dropCallback: (create, edit) - Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:  global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int $y, int $type)  The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback. $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link.  In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form:  def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ):  The values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above.  The other way to specify the callback in Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys "dragControl", "dropControl", "messages", "x", "y", "type".  The "dragControl" value is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be "print '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'")
        enable: (create, edit, query) - The enable state of the control.  By default, this flag is set to true and the control is enabled.  Specify false and the control will appear dimmed or greyed-out indicating it is disabled.
        enableBackground: (create, edit, query) - Enables the background color of the control.
        enableKeyboardFocus: (create, edit, query) - If enabled, the user can navigate to the control with the tab key and select values with the keyboard or mouse. This flag would typically be used to turn off focus support from controls that get it by default, like Edit and List controls. If disabled, text in text fields can still be selected with the mouse but cannot be copied (except on Linux when "Middle Click Paste" is enabled).
        exists: (create) - Returns whether the specified object exists or not. Other flags are ignored.
        flat: (create, edit, query) - Sets whether the control will be a flat button (0 false, 1 true).

    This control supports up to 3 icon images and 4 different display styles.  The icon image displayed is the one that best fits the current size of the control given its current style.

    Args:
        align: (create, edit, query) - The label alignment.  Alignment values are "left", "right", and "center". By default, the label is aligned "center". Currently only available when -st/style is set to "iconAndTextCentered".
        annotation: (create, edit, query) - Annotate the control with an extra string value.
        backgroundColor: (create, edit, query) - The background color of the control. The arguments correspond to the red, green, and blue color components. Each component ranges in value from 0.0 to 1.0. When setting backgroundColor, the background is automatically enabled, unless enableBackground is also specified with a false value.
        changeCommand: (create, edit, query) - Command executed when the control's state is changed. Note that this flag should not be used in conjunction with onCommand and offCommand. That is, one should either use changeCommand and test the state of the control from inside the callback, or use onCommand and offCommand as separate callbacks.
        defineTemplate: (create) - Puts the command in a mode where any other flags and arguments are parsed and added to the command template specified in the argument. They will be used as default arguments in any subsequent invocations of the command when templateName is set as the current template.
        disabledImage: (create, edit, query) - Image used when the button is disabled. Image size must be the same as the image specified with the i/image flag. This is a Windows only flag.
        docTag: (create, edit, query) - Add a documentation flag to the control.  The documentation flag has a directory structure. (e.g., -dt render/multiLister/createNode/material)
        dragCallback: (create, edit) - Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:  global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods)  The proc returns a string array that is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type.  Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers CTRL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTRL, 3 == CTRL + SHIFT.  In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form:  def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ):  The values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above.  The other way to specify the callback in Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys "dragControl", "x", "y", "modifiers".  The "dragControl" value is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be "print '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'")
        dropCallback: (create, edit) - Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:  global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int $y, int $type)  The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback. $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link.  In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form:  def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ):  The values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above.  The other way to specify the callback in Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys "dragControl", "dropControl", "messages", "x", "y", "type".  The "dragControl" value is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be "print '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'")
        enable: (create, edit, query) - The enable state of the control.  By default, this flag is set to true and the control is enabled.  Specify false and the control will appear dimmed or greyed-out indicating it is disabled.
        enableBackground: (create, edit, query) - Enables the background color of the control.
        enableKeyboardFocus: (create, edit, query) - If enabled, the user can navigate to the control with the tab key and select values with the keyboard or mouse. This flag would typically be used to turn off focus support from controls that get it by default, like Edit and List controls. If disabled, text in text fields can still be selected with the mouse but cannot be copied (except on Linux when "Middle Click Paste" is enabled).
        exists: (create) - Returns whether the specified object exists or not. Other flags are ignored.
        flat: (create, edit, query) - Sets whether the control will be a flat button (0 false, 1 true).
        flipX: (create, edit, query) - Is the image flipped horizontally?
        flipY: (create, edit, query) - Is the image flipped vertically?
        font: (create, edit, query) - The font for the text.  Valid values are "boldLabelFont", "smallBoldLabelFont", "tinyBoldLabelFont", "plainLabelFont", "smallPlainLabelFont", "obliqueLabelFont", "smallObliqueLabelFont", "fixedWidthFont" and "smallFixedWidthFont".
        fullPathName: (query) - Return the full path name of the widget, which includes all the parents.

    This command creates/edits/queries a text scrolling list. The list can be in single select mode where only one item at at time is selected, or in multi-select mode where many items may be selected.

    Args:
        allowMultiSelection: (create, edit, query) - Specify multi or single selection mode.
        annotation: (create, edit, query) - Annotate the control with an extra string value.
        append: (create, edit, multiuse) - Add an item to the end of the list.
        backgroundColor: (create, edit, query) - The background color of the control. The arguments correspond to the red, green, and blue color components. Each component ranges in value from 0.0 to 1.0. When setting backgroundColor, the background is automatically enabled, unless enableBackground is also specified with a false value.
        changeCommand: (create, edit) - Script to run when the list changes
        defineTemplate: (create) - Puts the command in a mode where any other flags and arguments are parsed and added to the command template specified in the argument. They will be used as default arguments in any subsequent invocations of the command when templateName is set as the current template.
        deselectAll: (create, edit) - Deselect all items.
        docTag: (create, edit, query) - Add a documentation flag to the control.  The documentation flag has a directory structure. (e.g., -dt render/multiLister/createNode/material)
        doubleClickCommand: (create, edit) - Specify the command to be executed when an item is double clicked.
        dragCallback: (create, edit) - Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:  global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods)  The proc returns a string array that is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type.  Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers CTRL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTRL, 3 == CTRL + SHIFT.  In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form:  def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ):  The values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above.  The other way to specify the callback in Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys "dragControl", "x", "y", "modifiers".  The "dragControl" value is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be "print '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'")
        dragFeedbackVisible: (create, edit) - Should the drag feedback be shown in the scrollbar?
        dropCallback: (create, edit) - Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:  global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int $y, int $type)  The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback. $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link.  In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form:  def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ):  The values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above.  The other way to specify the callback in Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys "dragControl", "dropControl", "messages", "x", "y", "type".  The "dragControl" value is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be "print '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'")
        dropRectCallback: (edit) - Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is hovering above the drop site.  It returns the shape of the rectangle to be drawn to highlight the entry, if the control can receive the dropped data. The MEL version of the callback is of the form:  global proc int[] callbackName(string $dropControl, int $x, int $y)  The return value is an array of size 4, with the parameters, in order, being the left and top coordinates of the rectangle to be drawn, followed by the width and height. This functionality is currently only implemented in MEL.
        editIndexed: (create, edit) - Index of the edited field
        editable: (create, edit) - Set the field to be editable or not
        enable: (create, edit, query) - The enable state of the control.  By default, this flag is set to true and the control is enabled.  Specify false and the control will appear dimmed or greyed-out indicating it is disabled.
        enableBackground: (create, edit, query) - Enables the background color of the control.
        enableKeyboardFocus: (create, edit, query) - If enabled, the user can navigate to the control with the tab key and select values with the keyboard or mouse. This flag would typically be used to turn off focus support from controls that get it by default, like Edit and List controls. If disabled, text in text fields can still be selected with the mouse but cannot be copied (except on Linux when "Middle Click Paste" is enabled).
        exists: (create) - Returns whether the specified object exists or not. Other flags are ignored.
        fullPathName: (query) - Return the full path name of the widget, which includes all the parents.

        isObscured: (query) - Return whether the control can actually be seen by the user. The control will be obscured if its state is invisible, if it is blocked (entirely or partially) by some other control, if it or a parent layout is unmanaged, or if the control's window is invisible or iconified.
        itemAt: (query) - Return the name of the item, if any, located at given point       In query mode, this flag needs a value.
        itemTextColor: (create, edit, multiuse) - Set the text color of the item at the given index. Arguments are: index, red, green, and blue. Indices are 1-based. Each color component ranges in value from 0.0 to 1.0.
        manage: (create, edit, query) - Manage state of the control.  An unmanaged control is not visible, nor does it take up any screen real estate.  All controls are created managed by default.
        noBackground: (create, edit) - Clear/reset the control's background. Passing true means the background should not be drawn at all, false means the background should be drawn.  The state of this flag is inherited by children of this control.
        numberOfIcons: (query) - Number of icons.
        numberOfPopupMenus: (query) - Return the number of popup menus attached to this control.
        numberOfRows: (query) - Number of visible rows.

        visibleChangeCommand: (create, edit, query) - Command that gets executed when visible state of the control changes.
        visualRectAt: (query) - Return the visual rectangle of the item, if any, located at given point. The result is a an array of 4 integers, in local coordinates, describing the rectangle, in the following order: left, top, width, height.       In query mode, this flag needs a value.
        width: (create, edit, query) - The width of the control.  The control will attempt to be this size if it is not overruled by parent layout conditions.

        noBackground: (create, edit) - Clear/reset the control's background. Passing true means the background should not be drawn at all, false means the background should be drawn.  The state of this flag is inherited by children of this control.
        numberOfPopupMenus: (query) - Return the number of popup menus attached to this control.
        overlayLabelBackColor: (create, edit, query) - The RGBA color of the shadow behind the label defined by imageOverlayLabel. Default is 50% transparent black: 0 0 0 .5

    This command creates a static image for non-xpm files. Any image file format supported by the file texture node is supported by this command.

    Args:
        annotation: (create, edit, query) - Annotate the control with an extra string value.
        backgroundColor: (create, edit, query) - The background color of the control. The arguments correspond to the red, green, and blue color components. Each component ranges in value from 0.0 to 1.0. When setting backgroundColor, the background is automatically enabled, unless enableBackground is also specified with a false value.
        defineTemplate: (create) - Puts the command in a mode where any other flags and arguments are parsed and added to the command template specified in the argument. They will be used as default arguments in any subsequent invocations of the command when templateName is set as the current template.
        docTag: (create, edit, query) - Add a documentation flag to the control.  The documentation flag has a directory structure. (e.g., -dt render/multiLister/createNode/material)
        dragCallback: (create, edit) - Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:  global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods)  The proc returns a string array that is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type.  Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers CTRL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTRL, 3 == CTRL + SHIFT.  In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form:  def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ):  The values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above.  The other way to specify the callback in Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys "dragControl", "x", "y", "modifiers".  The "dragControl" value is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be "print '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'")
        dropCallback: (create, edit) - Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:  global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int $y, int $type)  The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback. $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link.  In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form:  def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ):  The values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above.  The other way to specify the callback in Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys "dragControl", "dropControl", "messages", "x", "y", "type".  The "dragControl" value is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be "print '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'")
        enable: (create, edit, query) - The enable state of the control.  By default, this flag is set to true and the control is enabled.  Specify false and the control will appear dimmed or greyed-out indicating it is disabled.
        enableBackground: (create, edit, query) - Enables the background color of the control.
        enableKeyboardFocus: (create, edit, query) - If enabled, the user can navigate to the control with the tab key and select values with the keyboard or mouse. This flag would typically be used to turn off focus support from controls that get it by default, like Edit and List controls. If disabled, text in text fields can still be selected with the mouse but cannot be copied (except on Linux when "Middle Click Paste" is enabled).
        exists: (create) - Returns whether the specified object exists or not. Other flags are ignored.
        fullPathName: (query) - Return the full path name of the widget, which includes all the parents.
        height: (create, edit, query) - The height of the control.  The control will attempt to be this size if it is not overruled by parent layout conditions.
        highlightColor: (create, edit, query) - The highlight color of the control. The arguments correspond to the red, green, and blue color components. Each component ranges in value from 0.0 to 1.0.
        image: (create, edit, query) - Sets the image given the file name.
        isObscured: (query) - Return whether the control can actually be seen by the user. The control will be obscured if its state is invisible, if it is blocked (entirely or partially) by some other control, if it or a parent layout is unmanaged, or if the control's window is invisible or iconified.
        manage: (create, edit, query) - Manage state of the control.  An unmanaged control is not visible, nor does it take up any screen real estate.  All controls are created managed by default.

        columnOffset2: (create, edit) - This flag is used in conjunction with the -columnAttach2 flag.  If that flag is not used then this flag will be ignored.  It sets the offset for the two columns.  The offsets applied are based on the attachments specified with the -columnAttach2 flag.  Ignored if there are not exactly two columns.
        columnOffset3: (create, edit) - This flag is used in conjunction with the -columnAttach3 flag.  If that flag is not used then this flag will be ignored.  It sets the offset for the three columns.  The offsets applied are based on the attachments specified with the -columnAttach3 flag.  Ignored if there are not exactly three columns.

        defineTemplate: (create) - Puts the command in a mode where any other flags and arguments are parsed and added to the command template specified in the argument. They will be used as default arguments in any subsequent invocations of the command when templateName is set as the current template.
        docTag: (create, edit, query) - Add a documentation flag to the control.  The documentation flag has a directory structure. (e.g., -dt render/multiLister/createNode/material)
        dragCallback: (create, edit) - Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:  global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods)  The proc returns a string array that is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type.  Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers CTRL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTRL, 3 == CTRL + SHIFT.  In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form:  def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ):  The values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above.  The other way to specify the callback in Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys "dragControl", "x", "y", "modifiers".  The "dragControl" value is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be "print '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'")
        dragCommand: (create, edit) - Command string executed when dragging the invisible slider in any of the fields.
        dropCallback: (create, edit) - Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:  global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int $y, int $type)  The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback. $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link.  In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form:  def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ):  The values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above.  The other way to specify the callback in Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys "dragControl", "dropControl", "messages", "x", "y", "type".  The "dragControl" value is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be "print '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'")
        enable: (create, edit, query) - The enable state of the control.  By default, this flag is set to true and the control is enabled.  Specify false and the control will appear dimmed or greyed-out indicating it is disabled.
        enable1: (create, edit, query) - 
        enable2: (create, edit, query) - 
        enable3: (create, edit, query) - 
        enable4: (create, edit, query) - Enable state for the respective field.
        enableBackground: (create, edit, query) - Enables the background color of the control.
        enableKeyboardFocus: (create, edit, query) - If enabled, the user can navigate to the control with the tab key and select values with the keyboard or mouse. This flag would typically be used to turn off focus support from controls that get it by default, like Edit and List controls. If disabled, text in text fields can still be selected with the mouse but cannot be copied (except on Linux when "Middle Click Paste" is enabled).
        exists: (create) - Returns whether the specified object exists or not. Other flags are ignored.
        extraLabel: (create, edit, query) - If present on creation this specifies that there will be an extra label in the group.  Sets the string to be label text to the right of fields.
        fullPathName: (query) - Return the full path name of the widget, which includes all the parents.
        height: (create, edit, query) - The height of the control.  The control will attempt to be this size if it is not overruled by parent layout conditions.
        highlightColor: (create, edit, query) - The highlight color of the control. The arguments correspond to the red, green, and blue color components. Each component ranges in value from 0.0 to 1.0.
        isObscured: (query) - Return whether the control can actually be seen by the user. The control will be obscured if its state is invisible, if it is blocked (entirely or partially) by some other control, if it or a parent layout is unmanaged, or if the control's window is invisible or iconified.
        label: (create, edit, query) - If present on creation this specifies that there will be a label to the left of the fields.  Sets the string to be the label text.
        manage: (create, edit, query) - Manage state of the control.  An unmanaged control is not visible, nor does it take up any screen real estate.  All controls are created managed by default.
        noBackground: (create, edit) - Clear/reset the control's background. Passing true means the background should not be drawn at all, false means the background should be drawn.  The state of this flag is inherited by children of this control.
        numberOfFields: (create) - Set the number of fields on creation.  One to four fields are available.  The default is one field.
        numberOfPopupMenus: (query) - Return the number of popup menus attached to this control.
        parent: (create, query) - The parent layout for this control.
        popupMenuArray: (query) - Return the names of all the popup menus attached to this control.
        preventOverride: (create, edit, query) - If true, this flag prevents overriding the control's attribute via the control's right mouse button menu.
        rowAttach: (create, edit, multiuse) - Arguments are : column, attachment type, offset. Possible attachments are: top | bottom | both. Specifies attachment types and offsets for the entire row.
        statusBarMessage: (create, edit) - Extra string to display in the status bar when the mouse is over the control.
        useTemplate: (create) - Forces the command to use a command template other than the current one.
        value: (create, edit, query) - Values for all fields.
        value1: (create, edit, query) - 
        value2: (create, edit, query) - 
        value3: (create, edit, query) - 
        value4: (create, edit, query) - Value for the respective field.
        visible: (create, edit, query) - The visible state of the control.  A control is created visible by default.  Note that a control's actual appearance is also dependent on the visible state of its parent layout(s).
        visibleChangeCommand: (create, edit, query) - Command that gets executed when visible state of the control changes.
        width: (create, edit, query) - The width of the control.  The control will attempt to be this size if it is not overruled by parent layout conditions.

        docTag: (create, edit, query) - Add a documentation flag to the control.  The documentation flag has a directory structure. (e.g., -dt render/multiLister/createNode/material)
        dragCallback: (create, edit) - Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:  global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods)  The proc returns a string array that is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type.  Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers CTRL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTRL, 3 == CTRL + SHIFT.  In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form:  def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ):  The values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above.  The other way to specify the callback in Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys "dragControl", "x", "y", "modifiers".  The "dragControl" value is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be "print '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'")
        dragCommand: (create, edit) - The command string executed repeatedly during a drag of the slider.
        dropCallback: (create, edit) - Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:  global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int $y, int $type)  The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback. $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link.  In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form:  def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ):  The values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above.  The other way to specify the callback in Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys "dragControl", "dropControl", "messages", "x", "y", "type".  The "dragControl" value is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be "print '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'")
        enable: (create, edit, query) - The enable state of the control.  By default, this flag is set to true and the control is enabled.  Specify false and the control will appear dimmed or greyed-out indicating it is disabled.
        enableBackground: (create, edit, query) - Enables the background color of the control.
        enableKeyboardFocus: (create, edit, query) - If enabled, the user can navigate to the control with the tab key and select values with the keyboard or mouse. This flag would typically be used to turn off focus support from controls that get it by default, like Edit and List controls. If disabled, text in text fields can still be selected with the mouse but cannot be copied (except on Linux when "Middle Click Paste" is enabled).
        exists: (create) - Returns whether the specified object exists or not. Other flags are ignored.
        extraLabel: (create, edit, query) - If present on creation this specifies that there will be an extra label appearing after the slider.  Sets the string to be the text for the extra label.
        field: (create) - If true on creation the group will have an editable int field present that reflects the value of the slider.
        fieldMaxValue: (create, edit, query) - Maximum value that may be entered in the field.  This value may be set to any value greater than the -max/maxValue flag.  By default, it is equal to the -max/maxValue flag.
        fieldMinValue: (create, edit, query) - Minimum value that may be entered in the field.  This value may be set to any value less than the -min/minValue flag.  By default, it is equal to the -min/minValue flag.
        fieldStep: (create, edit, query) - Increment for the field.
        fullPathName: (query) - Return the full path name of the widget, which includes all the parents.
        height: (create, edit, query) - The height of the control.  The control will attempt to be this size if it is not overruled by parent layout conditions.
        highlightColor: (create, edit, query) - The highlight color of the control. The arguments correspond to the red, green, and blue color components. Each component ranges in value from 0.0 to 1.0.
        isObscured: (query) - Return whether the control can actually be seen by the user. The control will be obscured if its state is invisible, if it is blocked (entirely or partially) by some other control, if it or a parent layout is unmanaged, or if the control's window is invisible or iconified.
        label: (create, edit, query) - If present on creation the group will have static text. Returns a string on query.
        manage: (create, edit, query) - Manage state of the control.  An unmanaged control is not visible, nor does it take up any screen real estate.  All controls are created managed by default.
        maxValue: (create, edit, query) - Sets the maximum value for both the slider and the field.
        minValue: (create, edit, query) - Sets the minimum value for both the slider and the field.
        noBackground: (create, edit) - Clear/reset the control's background. Passing true means the background should not be drawn at all, false means the background should be drawn.  The state of this flag is inherited by children of this control.
        numberOfPopupMenus: (query) - Return the number of popup menus attached to this control.
        parent: (create, query) - The parent layout for this control.
        popupMenuArray: (query) - Return the names of all the popup menus attached to this control.
        preventOverride: (create, edit, query) - If true, this flag prevents overriding the control's attribute via the control's right mouse button menu.
        rowAttach: (create, edit, multiuse) - Arguments are : column, attachment type, offset. Possible attachments are: top | bottom | both. Specifies attachment types and offsets for the entire row.
        sliderStep: (create, edit, query) - On Linux the slider step value represents the amount the value will increase or decrease when you click either side of the slider.
        statusBarMessage: (create, edit) - Extra string to display in the status bar when the mouse is over the control.
        step: (create, edit, query) - Increment for both the slider and field.
        useTemplate: (create) - Forces the command to use a command template other than the current one.
        value: (create, edit, query) - Value of the group.
        visible: (create, edit, query) - The visible state of the control.  A control is created visible by default.  Note that a control's actual appearance is also dependent on the visible state of its parent layout(s).
        visibleChangeCommand: (create, edit, query) - Command that gets executed when visible state of the control changes.
        width: (create, edit, query) - The width of the control.  The control will attempt to be this size if it is not overruled by parent layout conditions.

The "dragControl" value is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be "print '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'")
        enable: (create, edit, query) - The enable state of the control.  By default, this flag is set to true and the control is enabled.  Specify false and the control will appear dimmed or greyed-out indicating it is disabled.
        enableBackground: (create, edit, query) - Enables the background color of the control.
        enableKeyboardFocus: (create, edit, query) - If enabled, the user can navigate to the control with the tab key and select values with the keyboard or mouse. This flag would typically be used to turn off focus support from controls that get it by default, like Edit and List controls. If disabled, text in text fields can still be selected with the mouse but cannot be copied (except on Linux when "Middle Click Paste" is enabled).
        exists: (create) - Returns whether the specified object exists or not. Other flags are ignored.
        fullPathName: (query) - Return the full path name of the widget, which includes all the parents.
        height: (create, edit, query) - The height of the control.  The control will attempt to be this size if it is not overruled by parent layout conditions.
        hideOnPlaybackCommand: (create, edit) - Command that is called when the hide on playback indicator of the layer button is pressed.
        highlightColor: (create, edit, query) - The highlight color of the control. The arguments correspond to the red, green, and blue color components. Each component ranges in value from 0.0 to 1.0.
        identification: (create, edit, query) - This is the integer identification number associated with the layer.
        isObscured: (query) - Return whether the control can actually be seen by the user. The control will be obscured if its state is invisible, if it is blocked (entirely or partially) by some other control, if it or a parent layout is unmanaged, or if the control's window is invisible or iconified.
        label: (create, edit, query) - Label text for the button.
        labelWidth: (query) - Query the width of the label part so as to determine if button clicks are in the label part or the colour swatch part.
        layerHideOnPlayback: (create, edit, query) - Indicates whether the layer is visible or invisible during the playback.
        layerState: (create, edit, query) - Describes the state of the layer.  This may be one of normal, template, or reference.
        layerVisible: (create, edit, query) - Indicates whether the layer is visible or invisible.
        manage: (create, edit, query) - Manage state of the control.  An unmanaged control is not visible, nor does it take up any screen real estate.  All controls are created managed by default.
        name: (create, query) - Name of the layer.
        noBackground: (create, edit) - Clear/reset the control's background. Passing true means the background should not be drawn at all, false means the background should be drawn.  The state of this flag is inherited by children of this control.
        numberOfPopupMenus: (query) - Return the number of popup menus attached to this control.
        parent: (create, query) - The parent layout for this control.
        popupMenuArray: (query) - Return the names of all the popup menus attached to this control.
        preventOverride: (create, edit, query) - If true, this flag prevents overriding the control's attribute via the control's right mouse button menu.
        renameCommand: (create, edit) - Set the command to call when the layer gets renamed. The string '#1' will be substituted with the control's name and '#2' will be replaced with the layer's new name.
        select: (create, edit, query) - Set this button to display as a selected layer.
        statusBarMessage: (create, edit) - Extra string to display in the status bar when the mouse is over the control.
        transparent: (create, edit, query) - Indicate whether the layer color is visible or transparent.
        typeCommand: (create, edit) - Command that is called when the type indicator of the layer button is pressed.
        useTemplate: (create) - Forces the command to use a command template other than the current one.
        visible: (create, edit, query) - The visible state of the control.  A control is created visible by default.  Note that a control's actual appearance is also dependent on the visible state of its parent layout(s).
        visibleChangeCommand: (create, edit, query) - Command that gets executed when visible state of the control changes.
        visibleCommand: (create, edit) - Command that is called when the visibility indicator of the layer button is pressed.
        width: (create, edit, query) - The width of the control.  The control will attempt to be this size if it is not overruled by parent layout conditions.

        backgroundColor: (create, edit, query) - The background color of the control. The arguments correspond to the red, green, and blue color components. Each component ranges in value from 0.0 to 1.0. When setting backgroundColor, the background is automatically enabled, unless enableBackground is also specified with a false value.
        childArray: (query) - Returns a string array of the names of the layout's immediate children.
        defineTemplate: (create) - Puts the command in a mode where any other flags and arguments are parsed and added to the command template specified in the argument. They will be used as default arguments in any subsequent invocations of the command when templateName is set as the current template.
        docTag: (create, edit, query) - Add a documentation flag to the control.  The documentation flag has a directory structure. (e.g., -dt render/multiLister/createNode/material)
        dragCallback: (create, edit) - Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:  global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods)  The proc returns a string array that is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type.  Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers CTRL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTRL, 3 == CTRL + SHIFT.  In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.

The MEL version of the callback is of the form:  global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int $y, int $type)  The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback. $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link.  In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form:  def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ):  The values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above.

    """
    A menuEditor displays the contents of a popup menu and allows the menu's items to be edited. Menu items are represented by labelled icons which can be dragged around within the editor to change the menu's layout.  Various objects can be dragged and dropped into the menuEditor to create new menu items: toolButtons from the shelf or toolbox, shelfButtons from the shelf, iconTextButtons with attached commands, and scripts from the command window.

    Args:
        annotation: (create, edit, query) - Annotate the control with an extra string value.
        backgroundColor: (create, edit, query) - The background color of the control. The arguments correspond to the red, green, and blue color components. Each component ranges in value from 0.0 to 1.0. When setting backgroundColor, the background is automatically enabled, unless enableBackground is also specified with a false value.
        cellHeight: (edit, query) - The height of the icons in the menuEditor.
        cellWidth: (edit, query) - The width of the icons in the menuEditor.
        cellWidthHeight: (edit) - The width and height of the icons in the menuEditor.
        checkBoxPresent: (edit, query) - This controls whether a menu item has a check box or not. The arguments are a flag indicating presence, followed by the position of the menu item. This flag is ignored if the menu item is a submenu item. If queried, an array of booleans is returned containing all the flags. The first 8 entries of the array correspond to radial items (in order, "N", "NE", ... "NW"), and all later entries correspond to overflow (or linear) menu items.
        checkBoxState: (edit, query) - The state of the check box associated with a menu item. The arguments are a flag indicating state, followed by the position of the menu item. This flag is ignored if the menu item does not have a check box. If queried, an array of booleans is returned containing all the flags. The first 8 entries of the array correspond to radial items (in order, "N", "NE", ... "NW"), and all later entries correspond to overflow (or linear) menu items.
        childArray: (query) - Returns a string array of the names of the layout's immediate children.
        command: (edit, query) - The command or script executed by a menu item. The arguments are the command string or script name, followed by the position of the menu item. This flag is ignored if the menu item is a submenu item or a separator item. If queried, an array of strings is returned containing all the commands. The first 8 entries of the array correspond to radial items (in order, "N", "NE", ... "NW"), and all later entries correspond to overflow (or linear) menu items.
        defineTemplate: (create) - Puts the command in a mode where any other flags and arguments are parsed and added to the command template specified in the argument. They will be used as default arguments in any subsequent invocations of the command when templateName is set as the current template.
        delete: (edit) - Deletes the menu item at the given position, removing it from the menu.  If the menu item has a submenu, and a sub-menuEditor is open and attached to it, then the sub-menuEditor's window and all its child menuEditor windows will be closed recursively.
        docTag: (create, edit, query) - Add a documentation flag to the control.  The documentation flag has a directory structure. (e.g., -dt render/multiLister/createNode/material)
        dragCallback: (create, edit) - Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:  global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods)  The proc returns a string array that is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type.  Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers CTRL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTRL, 3 == CTRL + SHIFT.  In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form:  def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ):  The values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above.  The other way to specify the callback in Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys "dragControl", "x", "y", "modifiers".  The "dragControl" value is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be "print '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'")
        dropCallback: (create, edit) - Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:  global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int $y, int $type)  The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback. $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link.  In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form:  def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ):  The values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above.  The other way to specify the callback in Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys "dragControl", "dropControl", "messages", "x", "y", "type".  The "dragControl" value is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be "print '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'")
        enable: (create, edit, query) - The enable state of the control.  By default, this flag is set to true and the control is enabled.  Specify false and the control will appear dimmed or greyed-out indicating it is disabled.
        enableBackground: (create, edit, query) - Enables the background color of the control.
        enableKeyboardFocus: (create, edit, query) - If enabled, the user can navigate to the control with the tab key and select values with the keyboard or mouse. This flag would typically be used to turn off focus support from controls that get it by default, like Edit and List controls. If disabled, text in text fields can still be selected with the mouse but cannot be copied (except on Linux when "Middle Click Paste" is enabled).
        exists: (create) - Returns whether the specified object exists or not. Other flags are ignored.
        fullPathName: (query) - Return the full path name of the widget, which includes all the parents.
        height: (create, edit, query) - The height of the control.  The control will attempt to be this size if it is not overruled by parent layout conditions.
        highlightColor: (create, edit, query) - The highlight color of the control. The arguments correspond to the red, green, and blue color components. Each component ranges in value from 0.0 to 1.0.
        iconMenuCallback: (create) - This is the name of a MEL callback procedure that is called to create the popup menus attached to icons in the menuEditor.  The callback is called once for each newly created icon, and once each time an icon is moved within the menuEditor.  Popup menus created by the callback should contain commands for editing the menu item associated with the icon.  Operations accessible through the menu should include deletion of the item, editing of the item's label/command/image/checkbox/optionbox, creation of a submenu, and popping up a sub-menuEditor.  The arguments to the callback must match this form:  callbackProc(string $menuEditorName, string $parentIconName, string $menuTitle, string $radialPosition, int $overflowRow);  The popup menu's parent should be $parentIconName.  Note that when a sub-menuEditor is created, this flag need not be re-specified as it adopts a default value equal to the value of its parent menuEditor's -imc/iconMenuCallback flag.
        image: (edit, query) - The filename of the icon associated with a menu item. This icon is displayed by the menuEditor to represent the menu item. The arguments are the icon filename, followed by the position of the menu item. If queried, an array of strings is returned containing all the icon filenames. The first 8 entries of the array correspond to radial items (in order, "N", "NE", ... "NW"), and all later entries correspond to overflow (or linear) menu items.
        isObscured: (query) - Return whether the control can actually be seen by the user. The control will be obscured if its state is invisible, if it is blocked (entirely or partially) by some other control, if it or a parent layout is unmanaged, or if the control's window is invisible or iconified.
        label: (edit, query) - The label of a menu item. The arguments are the label text, followed by the position of the menu item. If queried, an array of strings is returned containing all the labels. The first 8 entries of the array correspond to radial items (in order, "N", "NE", ... "NW"), and all later entries correspond to overflow (or linear) menu items.
        manage: (create, edit, query) - Manage state of the control.  An unmanaged control is not visible, nor does it take up any screen real estate.  All controls are created managed by default.
        menuItemTypes: (query) - This is a query only flag.  Returns an array of strings indicating the type of contents in each cell of the menuEditor.  Cells can be "vacant", or may contain a regular menu "item", or a "separator", or a "submenu" item.  In each case, the corresponding string is returned. The first 8 entries of the array correspond to radial items (in order, "N", "NE", ... "NW"), and all later entries correspond to overflow (or linear) menu items.
        noBackground: (create, edit) - Clear/reset the control's background. Passing true means the background should not be drawn at all, false means the background should be drawn.  The state of this flag is inherited by children of this control.
        numberOfChildren: (query) - Returns in an int the number of immediate children of the layout.
        numberOfPopupMenus: (query) - Return the number of popup menus attached to this control.
        optionBoxCommand: (edit, query) - The command or script executed by a menu item's associated option box item. The arguments are the command string or script name, followed by the position of the menu item. This flag is ignored if the menu item does not have an associated option box item. If queried, an array of strings is returned containing all the commands. The first 8 entries of the array correspond to radial items (in order, "N", "NE", ... "NW"), and all later entries correspond to overflow (or linear) menu items.
        optionBoxPresent: (edit, query) - This controls whether a menu item has an associated option box item or not. The arguments are a flag indicating presence, followed by the position of the menu item. This flag is ignored if the menu item is a submenu item. If queried, an array of booleans is returned containing all the flags. The first 8 entries of the array correspond to radial items (in order, "N", "NE", ... "NW"), and all later entries correspond to overflow (or linear) menu items.
        parent: (create, query) - The parent layout for this control.
        popupMenuArray: (query) - Return the names of all the popup menus attached to this control.
        preventOverride: (create, edit, query) - If true, this flag prevents overriding the control's attribute via the control's right mouse button menu.
        radioButtonPresent: (edit, query) - This controls whether a menu item has a radio button or not. The arguments are a flag indicating presence, followed by the position of the menu item. This flag is ignored if the menu item is a submenu item. If queried, an array of booleans is returned containing all the flags. The first 8 entries of the array correspond to radial items (in order, "N", "NE", ... "NW"), and all later entries correspond to overflow (or linear) menu items.
        radioButtonState: (edit, query) - The state of the radio button associated with a menu item. The arguments are a flag indicating state, followed by the position of the menu item. This flag is ignored if the menu item does not have a radio button. If queried, an array of booleans is returned containing all the flags. The first 8 entries of the array correspond to radial items (in order, "N", "NE", ... "NW"), and all later entries correspond to overflow (or linear) menu items.
        separator: (edit, query) - In edit mode this adds a separator to the menuEditor at the specified position. The parameters are the radialPosition and the overflowRow. If queried, an array of booleans is returned indicating if the item is a separator item. The first 8 entries of the array correspond to radial items (in order, "N", "NE", ... "NW"), and all later entries correspond to overflow (or linear) menu items.
        statusBarMessage: (create, edit) - Extra string to display in the status bar when the mouse is over the control.
        style: (edit, query) - This is the style of icons within the menuEditor. Valid styles are "iconOnly", "textOnly", "iconAndTextHorizontal" and "iconAndTextVertical".
        subMenuAt: (edit) - Creates a submenu item at the given position.  A submenu item created within the radial portion of a menu will overwrite whatever item (if any) is currently at the given position. A submenu item created within the overflow (linear) portion of a menu will be inserted before the item currently at the given position.
        subMenuEditorWindow: (create) - The name of the window which contains a sub-menuEditor.  Only use when creatitg a sub-menuEditor. This window will automatically be closed if a parent menuEditor is closed or if a parent menu item is deleted.
        subMenuEditorsOpen: (query) - This is a query only flag.  Returns an array of booleans, each of which indicates if a sub-menuEditor is open and attached to the menu item in a particular cell.  One boolean is returned for each cell in the menuEditor, even if the cell is vacant or contains a non-submenu item (false will be returned in both these cases).  Only when a cell contains a submenu item can true possibily be returned. The first 8 entries of the array correspond to radial items (in order, "N", "NE", ... "NW"), and all later entries correspond to overflow (or linear) menu items.
        subMenuOf: (create) - Attaches a sub-menuEditor to its parent menuEditor.  Only use when creatitg a sub-menuEditor. The arguments are the name of the parent menuEditor, followed by the position of a submenu item within the parent. A submenu item must already exist within the parent at the given position. A submenu item cannot have multiple sub-menuEditors attached to it.
        topLevelMenu: (edit, query) - The popup menu to attach to the editor.  All editing operations performed in the editor (i.e. inserting/deleting/moving an item) will be immediately reflected in this menu. This flag is ignored if the editor is a sub-menuEditor.  The editor will update gracefully if the value of the flag is changed from its initial value.
        useTemplate: (create) - Forces the command to use a command template other than the current one.
        visible: (create, edit, query) - The visible state of the control.  A control is created visible by default.  Note that a control's actual appearance is also dependent on the visible state of its parent layout(s).
        visibleChangeCommand: (create, edit, query) - Command that gets executed when visible state of the control changes.
        width: (create, edit, query) - The width of the control.  The control will attempt to be this size if it is not overruled by parent layout conditions.

        collection: (create, query) - To explicitly add a radio menu item to a radioMenuItemCollection.
        command: (create, edit, query) - Attaches a command/script that will be executed when the item is selected. Note this command is not executed when the menu item is in an optionMenu control.
        data: (create, edit, query) - Attaches a piece of user-defined data to the menu item.
        defineTemplate: (create) - Puts the command in a mode where any other flags and arguments are parsed and added to the command template specified in the argument. They will be used as default arguments in any subsequent invocations of the command when templateName is set as the current template.
        divider: (create, query) - Creates a divider menu item.
        dividerLabel: (create, edit, query) - Adds a label to a divider menu item.
        docTag: (create, edit, query) - Attaches a tag to the menu item.
        dragDoubleClickCommand: (create, edit, query) - If the menu item is put on the shelf then this command will be invoked when the corresponding shelf object is double clicked.

        echoCommand: (create, edit, query) - Specify whether the action attached with the c/command flag should echo to the command output areas when invoked. This flag is false by default and must be specified with the c/command flag.
        enable: (create, edit, query) - Enable state for the menu item.  A disabled menu item is dimmed and unresponsive.  An enabled menu item is selectable and has normal appearance.
        enableCommandRepeat: (create, edit, query) - This flag only affects menu items to which a command can be attached.  Specify true and the command may be repeated by executing the command repeatLast.  This flag is true by default for all items except for option box items.
        exists: (create) - Returns whether the specified object exists or not. Other flags are ignored.
        familyImage: (query) - Get the filename of the family icon associated with the menu. The family icon will be used for the shelf unless an icon is specified with the image flag.
        image: (create, edit, query) - The filename of the icon associated with the menu item.  If the menu containing the menu item is being edited with a menuEditor widget, then the menuEditor will use this icon to represent the menu item. This icon will be displayed on the shelf when the menu item is placed there.
        imageOverlayLabel: (create, edit, query) - Specify a short (5 character) text string to be overlayed on top of the icon associated with the menu item. This is primarily a mechanism for differentiating menu items that are using a Family icon due to the fact that an icon image had not been explicitly defined. The image overlay label will not be used if an icon image is defined for the menu item.
        insertAfter: (create) - Specify After which item the new one will be placed. If this flag is not specified, item is added at the end of the menu. Use the empty string "" to insert before the first item of the menu.

        longDivider: (create, edit, query) - Indicate whether the divider is long or short. Has no effect if divider label is set. Default is true.
        optionBox: (create, query) - Indicates that the menu item will be an option box item.  This item will appear to the right of the preceeding menu item.
        optionBoxIcon: (create, edit, query) - The filename of an icon to be used instead of the usual option box icon. The icon is searched for in the folder specified by the XBMLANGPATH environment variable. The icon can be any size, but will be resized to the standard 16x16 pixels when drawn.
        parent: (create) - Specify the menu that the item will appear in.
        postMenuCommand: (create, edit, query) - Specify a script to be executed when the submenu is about to be shown.
        postMenuCommandOnce: (create, edit, query) - Indicate the pmc/postMenuCommand should only be invoked once.  Default value is false, ie. the pmc/postMenuCommand is invoked everytime the sub menu is shown.
        radialPosition: (create, edit, query) - The radial position of the menu item if it is in a Marking Menu.  Radial positions are given in the form of a cardinal direction, and may be "N", "NW", "W", "SW", "S", "SE", "E" or "NE".
        radioButton: (create, edit, query) - Creates a radio button menu item.  Argument specifies the radio button value.

Note: command will be set to the runTimeCommand itself.
        sourceType: (create, edit, query) - Set the language type for a command script. Can only be used in conjunction with a command flag.  Without this flag, commands are assumed to be the same language of the executing script.  In query mode, will return the language of the specified command. Valid values are "mel" and "python".
        subMenu: (create, query) - Indicates that the item will have a submenu. Subsequent menuItems will be added to the submenu until setParent -menu is called.  Note that a submenu item creates a menu object and consequently the menu command may be used on the submenu item.
        tearOff: (create, query) - For the case where the menu item is a sub menu this flag will make the sub menu tear-off-able. Note that this flag has no effect on the other menu item types.
        useTemplate: (create) - Forces the command to use a command template other than the current one.
        version: (create, edit, query) - Specify the version that this menu item feature was introduced. The argument should be given as a string of the version number (e.g. "2013", "2014"). Currently only accepts major version numbers (e.g. 2013 Ext 1, or 2013.5 should be given as "2014").
        visible: (create, edit, query) - The visible state of the menu item.  A menu item is created visible by default.  Note that a menu item's actual appearance is also dependent on the visible state of its parent layout(s).

    This command creates a message line where tool feedback is shown.

    Args:
        annotation: (create, edit, query) - Annotate the control with an extra string value.
        backgroundColor: (create, edit, query) - The background color of the control. The arguments correspond to the red, green, and blue color components. Each component ranges in value from 0.0 to 1.0. When setting backgroundColor, the background is automatically enabled, unless enableBackground is also specified with a false value.
        defineTemplate: (create) - Puts the command in a mode where any other flags and arguments are parsed and added to the command template specified in the argument. They will be used as default arguments in any subsequent invocations of the command when templateName is set as the current template.
        docTag: (create, edit, query) - Add a documentation flag to the control.  The documentation flag has a directory structure. (e.g., -dt render/multiLister/createNode/material)
        dragCallback: (create, edit) - Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:  global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods)  The proc returns a string array that is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type.  Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers CTRL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTRL, 3 == CTRL + SHIFT.  In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form:  def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ):  The values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above.  The other way to specify the callback in Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys "dragControl", "x", "y", "modifiers".  The "dragControl" value is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be "print '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'")
        dropCallback: (create, edit) - Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:  global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int $y, int $type)  The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback. $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link.  In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form:  def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ):  The values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above.  The other way to specify the callback in Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys "dragControl", "dropControl", "messages", "x", "y", "type".  The "dragControl" value is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be "print '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'")
        enable: (create, edit, query) - The enable state of the control.  By default, this flag is set to true and the control is enabled.  Specify false and the control will appear dimmed or greyed-out indicating it is disabled.
        enableBackground: (create, edit, query) - Enables the background color of the control.
        enableKeyboardFocus: (create, edit, query) - If enabled, the user can navigate to the control with the tab key and select values with the keyboard or mouse. This flag would typically be used to turn off focus support from controls that get it by default, like Edit and List controls. If disabled, text in text fields can still be selected with the mouse but cannot be copied (except on Linux when "Middle Click Paste" is enabled).
        exists: (create) - Returns whether the specified object exists or not. Other flags are ignored.
        fullPathName: (query) - Return the full path name of the widget, which includes all the parents.
        height: (create, edit, query) - The height of the control.  The control will attempt to be this size if it is not overruled by parent layout conditions.
        highlightColor: (create, edit, query) - The highlight color of the control. The arguments correspond to the red, green, and blue color components. Each component ranges in value from 0.0 to 1.0.
        isObscured: (query) - Return whether the control can actually be seen by the user. The control will be obscured if its state is invisible, if it is blocked (entirely or partially) by some other control, if it or a parent layout is unmanaged, or if the control's window is invisible or iconified.
        manage: (create, edit, query) - Manage state of the control.  An unmanaged control is not visible, nor does it take up any screen real estate.  All controls are created managed by default.
        noBackground: (create, edit) - Clear/reset the control's background. Passing true means the background should not be drawn at all, false means the background should be drawn.  The state of this flag is inherited by children of this control.
        numberOfPopupMenus: (query) - Return the number of popup menus attached to this control.
        parent: (create, query) - The parent layout for this control.
        popupMenuArray: (query) - Return the names of all the popup menus attached to this control.
        preventOverride: (create, edit, query) - If true, this flag prevents overriding the control's attribute via the control's right mouse button menu.
        statusBarMessage: (create, edit) - Extra string to display in the status bar when the mouse is over the control.
        useTemplate: (create) - Forces the command to use a command template other than the current one.
        visible: (create, edit, query) - The visible state of the control.  A control is created visible by default.  Note that a control's actual appearance is also dependent on the visible state of its parent layout(s).
        visibleChangeCommand: (create, edit, query) - Command that gets executed when visible state of the control changes.
        width: (create, edit, query) - The width of the control.  The control will attempt to be this size if it is not overruled by parent layout conditions.

Note that this list does not take into account visibility (based on camera frustum or flags), it purely captures the objects which are considered when rendering the view.
        fluids: (edit, query) - Turn on/off the display of fluids for the view of the model editor.
        fogColor: (edit, query) - The color used for hardware fogging.

If the value specified is larger than the OpenGL maximim textures size for the graphics hardware it will be clamped to the OpenGL size.  If many large textures are used in a scene reducing this value improves performance.  On Impact texture memory is pinned in RAM so using large textures can cause reliability and performance problems. Again reducing this value will help. Software rendering does not use this value. This flag is obsolete as of Maya 6.5. The maxTextureResolution/mtr argument on the displayPref command should be used instead.
        textureMemoryUsed: (query) - Returns the total number of bytes used by all texture maps.

        useReducedRenderer: (create, edit, query) - Set true if using the reduced renderer
        useTemplate: (create) - Forces the command to use a command template other than the current one.
        userNode: (edit, query) - Allows the user to associate a node name with the modelEditor. The value is automatically updated in the event the node is deleted or renamed.
        viewObjects: (query) - Returns the name (if any) of the objectSet which contains the list of objects visible in the view if viewSelected is true and the list of objects being displayed does not come from the active list.

    Args:
        annotation: (create, edit, query) - Annotate the control with an extra string value.
        backgroundColor: (create, edit, query) - The background color of the control. The arguments correspond to the red, green, and blue color components. Each component ranges in value from 0.0 to 1.0. When setting backgroundColor, the background is automatically enabled, unless enableBackground is also specified with a false value.
        changeCommand: (create, edit, query) - This command is executed when the field text is changed by the user.
        defineTemplate: (create) - Puts the command in a mode where any other flags and arguments are parsed and added to the command template specified in the argument. They will be used as default arguments in any subsequent invocations of the command when templateName is set as the current template.
        docTag: (create, edit, query) - Add a documentation flag to the control.  The documentation flag has a directory structure. (e.g., -dt render/multiLister/createNode/material)
        dragCallback: (create, edit) - Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:  global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods)  The proc returns a string array that is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type.  Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers CTRL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTRL, 3 == CTRL + SHIFT.  In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form:  def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ):  The values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above.  The other way to specify the callback in Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys "dragControl", "x", "y", "modifiers".  The "dragControl" value is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be "print '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'")
        drawInactiveFrame: (create, edit, query) - Sets whether the name field draws itself with a frame when it is inactive. By default, this option is false.
        dropCallback: (create, edit) - Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:  global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int $y, int $type)  The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback. $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link.  In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form:  def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ):  The values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above.  The other way to specify the callback in Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys "dragControl", "dropControl", "messages", "x", "y", "type".  The "dragControl" value is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be "print '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'")
        enable: (create, edit, query) - The enable state of the control.  By default, this flag is set to true and the control is enabled.  Specify false and the control will appear dimmed or greyed-out indicating it is disabled.
        enableBackground: (create, edit, query) - Enables the background color of the control.
        enableKeyboardFocus: (create, edit, query) - If enabled, the user can navigate to the control with the tab key and select values with the keyboard or mouse. This flag would typically be used to turn off focus support from controls that get it by default, like Edit and List controls. If disabled, text in text fields can still be selected with the mouse but cannot be copied (except on Linux when "Middle Click Paste" is enabled).
        exists: (create) - Returns whether the specified object exists or not. Other flags are ignored.
        fullPathName: (query) - Return the full path name of the widget, which includes all the parents.
        height: (create, edit, query) - The height of the control.  The control will attempt to be this size if it is not overruled by parent layout conditions.
        highlightColor: (create, edit, query) - The highlight color of the control. The arguments correspond to the red, green, and blue color components. Each component ranges in value from 0.0 to 1.0.
        isObscured: (query) - Return whether the control can actually be seen by the user. The control will be obscured if its state is invisible, if it is blocked (entirely or partially) by some other control, if it or a parent layout is unmanaged, or if the control's window is invisible or iconified.
        manage: (create, edit, query) - Manage state of the control.  An unmanaged control is not visible, nor does it take up any screen real estate.  All controls are created managed by default.
        nameChangeCommand: (create, edit, query) - This command is executed when the name of the node changes. NOTE: this will be executed when the node name changes, whether or not the name-change originated with the user typing into the field. If you want to attach a command to be executed when the user types into the field, use the -cc/changeCommand flag.
        noBackground: (create, edit) - Clear/reset the control's background. Passing true means the background should not be drawn at all, false means the background should be drawn.  The state of this flag is inherited by children of this control.
        numberOfPopupMenus: (query) - Return the number of popup menus attached to this control.
        object: (create, edit, query) - Attaches the field to the named dag/ufe object, so that the field will always display the object's name.
        parent: (create, query) - The parent layout for this control.
        popupMenuArray: (query) - Return the names of all the popup menus attached to this control.
        preventOverride: (create, edit, query) - If true, this flag prevents overriding the control's attribute via the control's right mouse button menu.
        receiveFocusCommand: (create, edit, query) - Command executed when the field receives focus.
        statusBarMessage: (create, edit) - Extra string to display in the status bar when the mouse is over the control.
        useTemplate: (create) - Forces the command to use a command template other than the current one.
        visible: (create, edit, query) - The visible state of the control.  A control is created visible by default.  Note that a control's actual appearance is also dependent on the visible state of its parent layout(s).
        visibleChangeCommand: (create, edit, query) - Command that gets executed when visible state of the control changes.
        width: (create, edit, query) - The width of the control.  The control will attempt to be this size if it is not overruled by parent layout conditions.

        docTag: (create, edit, query) - Attaches a tag to the editor.
        dotFormat: (edit, query) - In query mode: Get the graph information in DOT format. The flag argument specifies a file path to write to. If "-" is supplied, the data is returned as a string, otherwise the size in bytes of the written file is returned. In edit mode: Sets the positions of nodes in the graph from a Graphviz output file in plain format. Only the node position, width and height information is used. If the argument starts with "graph ", it will be treated as the plain data instead of a filename.       In query mode, this flag needs a value.
        downstream: (create, edit) - Include nodes that are downstream of the root nodes.
        duplicateTab: (create, edit) - Duplicates the tab at the specified index, placing it at the second optional (Python only) specified index. To place duplicated tab at the end use -1.

    The nodeOutliner command creates, edits and queries an outline control that shows dependency nodes and their attributes. Compound attributes are further expandable to show their children. Additional configure flags allow multi selection, customizable commands to issue upon selection, and showing connections (and connectability) to a single input attribute. There are also the abilities to add/remove/replace nodes through the command line interface, and drag/add.

    Args:
        addCommand: (create, edit, query) - Command executed when the node outliner adds something. String commands use substitution of the term %node for whatever is added, eg, if you want to print the object added, the command should be "print(\"%node \\n\")".  Callable python objects are passed the node name.
        addObject: (edit) - add the given object to the display
        annotation: (create, edit, query) - Annotate the control with an extra string value.
        attrAlphaOrder: (create, edit, query) - Specify how attributes are to be sorted.  Current recognised values are "default" for no sorting and "ascend" to sort attributes from 'a' to ''z' and "descend" to sort from 'z' to 'a'. Notes: a) this only applies to top level attributes.
        backgroundColor: (create, edit, query) - The background color of the control. The arguments correspond to the red, green, and blue color components. Each component ranges in value from 0.0 to 1.0. When setting backgroundColor, the background is automatically enabled, unless enableBackground is also specified with a false value.
        connectivity: (edit, query) - Takes an attribute argument ("nodeName.attributeName"), dims any attributes that can't connect to the given, and highlights any attributes already connected
        currentSelection: (query) - Retruns a string array containing what is currently selected
        defineTemplate: (create) - Puts the command in a mode where any other flags and arguments are parsed and added to the command template specified in the argument. They will be used as default arguments in any subsequent invocations of the command when templateName is set as the current template.
        docTag: (create, edit, query) - Add a documentation flag to the control.  The documentation flag has a directory structure. (e.g., -dt render/multiLister/createNode/material)
        dragCallback: (create, edit) - Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:  global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods)  The proc returns a string array that is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type.  Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers CTRL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTRL, 3 == CTRL + SHIFT.  In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form:  def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ):  The values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above.  The other way to specify the callback in Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys "dragControl", "x", "y", "modifiers".  The "dragControl" value is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be "print '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'")
        dropCallback: (create, edit) - Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:  global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int $y, int $type)  The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback. $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link.  In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form:  def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ):  The values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above.  The other way to specify the callback in Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys "dragControl", "dropControl", "messages", "x", "y", "type".  The "dragControl" value is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be "print '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'")
        enable: (create, edit, query) - The enable state of the control.  By default, this flag is set to true and the control is enabled.  Specify false and the control will appear dimmed or greyed-out indicating it is disabled.
        enableBackground: (create, edit, query) - Enables the background color of the control.
        enableKeyboardFocus: (create, edit, query) - If enabled, the user can navigate to the control with the tab key and select values with the keyboard or mouse. This flag would typically be used to turn off focus support from controls that get it by default, like Edit and List controls. If disabled, text in text fields can still be selected with the mouse but cannot be copied (except on Linux when "Middle Click Paste" is enabled).
        exists: (create) - Returns whether the specified object exists or not. Other flags are ignored.
        fullPathName: (query) - Return the full path name of the widget, which includes all the parents.
        height: (create, edit, query) - The height of the control.  The control will attempt to be this size if it is not overruled by parent layout conditions.
        highlightColor: (create, edit, query) - The highlight color of the control. The arguments correspond to the red, green, and blue color components. Each component ranges in value from 0.0 to 1.0.
        isObscured: (query) - Return whether the control can actually be seen by the user. The control will be obscured if its state is invisible, if it is blocked (entirely or partially) by some other control, if it or a parent layout is unmanaged, or if the control's window is invisible or iconified.
        lastClickedNode: (query) - Returns a string with the last clicked node
        lastMenuChoice: (query) - Returns the text of the most recent menu selection.
        longNames: (edit, query) - Controls whether long or short attribute names will be used in the interface.  Note that this flag is ignored if the niceNames flag is set.  Default is short names. Queried, returns a boolean.
        manage: (create, edit, query) - Manage state of the control.  An unmanaged control is not visible, nor does it take up any screen real estate.  All controls are created managed by default.
        menuCommand: (edit) - Attaches the given command to each item in the popup menu.
        menuMultiOption: (edit, query) - Sets whether a menu option labelled "next available" will appear as the first option on any multi-attribute's right mouse button menu.  Defaults to True.
        multiSelect: (edit, query) - Allow multiSelect; more than one thing to be selected at a time
        niceNames: (edit, query) - Controls whether the attribute names will be displayed in a more user-friendly, readable way.  When this is on, the longNames flag is ignored.  When this is off, attribute names will be displayed either long or short, according to the longNames flag. Default is on. Queried, returns a boolean.
        noBackground: (create, edit) - Clear/reset the control's background. Passing true means the background should not be drawn at all, false means the background should be drawn.  The state of this flag is inherited by children of this control.
        noConnectivity: (edit) - Reset the node outliner to not show any connectivity, ie, redraw all rows normally.
        nodesDisplayed: (query) - Returns a string array containing the list of nodes showing in the node Outliner
        numberOfPopupMenus: (query) - Return the number of popup menus attached to this control.
        parent: (create, query) - The parent layout for this control.
        popupMenuArray: (query) - Return the names of all the popup menus attached to this control.
        pressHighlightsUnconnected: (edit, query) - Sets whether clicking on an unconnected plug will select it or not.  Default is True.
        preventOverride: (create, edit, query) - If true, this flag prevents overriding the control's attribute via the control's right mouse button menu.
        redraw: (edit) - Redraws the displayed space
        redrawRow: (edit) - Redraws the given row
        remove: (edit, multiuse) - remove the given object from the display
        removeAll: (edit) - remove all objects from the display
        replace: (edit, query) - replace what's displayed with the given objects
        selectCommand: (edit, query) - Command issued by selecting.  Different from the c flag in that this command will only be issued if something is selected.
        showConnectedOnly: (edit, query) - show (true) or hide (false) only attributes that are connected matching input/output criteria
        showHidden: (edit, query) - show (true) or hide (false) UI invisible attributes that match the input/output criteria
        showInputs: (edit, query) - show only UI visible attributes that can be connected to
        showNonConnectable: (edit, query) - show (true) or hide (false) non connectable attributes that match the input/output criteria
        showNonKeyable: (edit, query) - show (true) or hide (false) non keyframeable (animatable) attributes that match the input/output criteria
        showOutputs: (edit, query) - show only UI visible attributes that can be connected from
        showPublished: (edit, query) - Show only published attributes for an asset or a member of an asset. This flag is ignored on nodes not related to assets.
        showReadOnly: (edit, query) - show only read only attributes attributes that can be connected from
        statusBarMessage: (create, edit) - Extra string to display in the status bar when the mouse is over the control.
        useTemplate: (create) - Forces the command to use a command template other than the current one.
        visible: (create, edit, query) - The visible state of the control.  A control is created visible by default.  Note that a control's actual appearance is also dependent on the visible state of its parent layout(s).
        visibleChangeCommand: (create, edit, query) - Command that gets executed when visible state of the control changes.
        width: (create, edit, query) - The width of the control.  The control will attempt to be this size if it is not overruled by parent layout conditions.

The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form:  def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ):  The values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above.  The other way to specify the callback in Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys "dragControl", "x", "y", "modifiers".  The "dragControl" value is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be "print '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'")
        dropCallback: (create, edit) - Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:  global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int $y, int $type)  The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback. $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link.  In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form:  def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ):  The values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above.  The other way to specify the callback in Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys "dragControl", "dropControl", "messages", "x", "y", "type".  The "dragControl" value is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be "print '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'")
        enable: (create, edit, query) - The enable state of the control.  By default, this flag is set to true and the control is enabled.  Specify false and the control will appear dimmed or greyed-out indicating it is disabled.
        enableBackground: (create, edit, query) - Enables the background color of the control.
        enableKeyboardFocus: (create, edit, query) - If enabled, the user can navigate to the control with the tab key and select values with the keyboard or mouse. This flag would typically be used to turn off focus support from controls that get it by default, like Edit and List controls. If disabled, text in text fields can still be selected with the mouse but cannot be copied (except on Linux when "Middle Click Paste" is enabled).
        exists: (create) - Returns whether the specified object exists or not. Other flags are ignored.
        fullPathName: (query) - Return the full path name of the widget, which includes all the parents.
        height: (create, edit, query) - The height of the control.  The control will attempt to be this size if it is not overruled by parent layout conditions.
        highlightColor: (create, edit, query) - The highlight color of the control. The arguments correspond to the red, green, and blue color components. Each component ranges in value from 0.0 to 1.0.
        isObscured: (query) - Return whether the control can actually be seen by the user. The control will be obscured if its state is invisible, if it is blocked (entirely or partially) by some other control, if it or a parent layout is unmanaged, or if the control's window is invisible or iconified.
        itemListLong: (query) - The long names of the menu items.
        itemListShort: (query) - The short names of the menu items.
        label: (create, edit, query) - The optional label text to the left of the popup menu.
        manage: (create, edit, query) - Manage state of the control.  An unmanaged control is not visible, nor does it take up any screen real estate.  All controls are created managed by default.
        maxVisibleItems: (create, edit, query) - The maximum number of items that are visible in the popup menu. If the popup contains more items than this, a scrollbar is added automatically.
        noBackground: (create, edit) - Clear/reset the control's background. Passing true means the background should not be drawn at all, false means the background should be drawn.  The state of this flag is inherited by children of this control.
        numberOfItems: (query) - The number of menu items.
        numberOfPopupMenus: (query) - Return the number of popup menus attached to this control.
        parent: (create, query) - The parent layout for this control.
        popupMenuArray: (query) - Return the names of all the popup menus attached to this control.
        postMenuCommand: (create, edit) - Specify a script to be executed when the popup menu is about to be shown.
        postMenuCommandOnce: (create, edit, query) - Indicate the -pmc/postMenuCommand should only be invoked once.  Default value is false, ie. the -pmc/postMenuCommand is invoked every time the popup menu is shown.
        preventOverride: (create, edit, query) - If true, this flag prevents overriding the control's attribute via the control's right mouse button menu.
        select: (create, edit, query) - The current menu item.  The argument and return value is 1-based.  Note that the current menu item can only be set if it is enabled.
        statusBarMessage: (create, edit) - Extra string to display in the status bar when the mouse is over the control.
        useTemplate: (create) - Forces the command to use a command template other than the current one.
        value: (create, edit, query) - The text of the current menu item.
        visible: (create, edit, query) - The visible state of the control.  A control is created visible by default.  Note that a control's actual appearance is also dependent on the visible state of its parent layout(s).
        visibleChangeCommand: (create, edit, query) - Command that gets executed when visible state of the control changes.
        width: (create, edit, query) - The width of the control.  The control will attempt to be this size if it is not overruled by parent layout conditions.

If so, the options can be "allAffecting" (no filter), "active" (only the active layers on the object will be displayed) and "animLayerEditor" (the settings will be taken from the animation layer editor).
        attrAlphaOrder: (create, edit, query) - Specify how attributes are to be sorted. Current recognised values are "default" for no sorting and "ascend" to sort attributes from 'a' to ''z' and "descend" to sort from 'z' to 'a'. Notes: a) this only applies to top level attributes.
        attrFilter: (create, edit, query) - Specifies the name of an itemFilter object to be placed on this editor. This filters the attributes displayed in the editor.

        defineTemplate: (create) - Puts the command in a mode where any other flags and arguments are parsed and added to the command template specified in the argument. They will be used as default arguments in any subsequent invocations of the command when templateName is set as the current template.
        directSelect: (create, edit) - If true then clicking on an item in the outliner will add or remove just that item from the selection connection. If false then clicking on an item in the outliner causes the selection connection to be reloaded with the currently selected items in the outliner.
        displayMode: (create, edit, query) - Affects how the outliner displays when a filter is applied. List mode is a non-indented flat list. DAG mode indents to represent the hierarchical structure of the model.

        getCurrentSetOfItem: (query) - Returns the current set of item at the given row. As an item can belong to number of sets, current set is the set to which the item belongs to currently.
        highlightActive: (create, edit, query) - This flag specifies whether or not the outliner should highlight objects that are active. Note: if the outliner is driving the contents of another editor, setting highlightActive to true may produce unexpected behavior.
        highlightConnection: (create, edit, query) - Specifies the name of a selectionConnection object that the editor will synchronize with its highlight list. Not all editors have a highlight list. For those that do, it is a secondary selection list.
        highlightSecondary: (create, edit, query) - This flag specifies whether or not the outliner should highlight objects that are contained in the highlightConnection.
        ignoreDagHierarchy: (create, edit, query) - This flag specifies whether or not DAG objects are displayed in their DAG hierarchy. Warning: using this flag without some other form of sensible filtering will lead to a very confusing outliner.

        masterOutliner: (create, edit, query) - This flag is the name of an outliner that this outliner will share the objects and state from. When an outliner is shared, all of its state information comes from, and is applied to, the primary outliner.
        niceNames: (edit, query) - Controls whether the attribute names will be displayed in a more user-friendly, readable way.  When this is on, the longNames flag is ignored.  When this is off, attribute names will be displayed either long or short, according to the longNames flag. Default is on. Queried, returns a boolean.
        object: (query) - This flag is used together with the parentObject flag to get the name of the parent object for the specified object.
        organizeByClip: (create, edit, query) - If true then when a node with Time Editor clips is displayed, attributes will be displayed according to the clip(s) it belongs to. eg:  Clip1 Attr1 Attr2 Clip2 Attr1  If it is false then the outliner will be organized primarily by attributes. eg:  Attr1 Clip1 Clip2 Attr2 Clip1

        refresh: (edit) - Causes the outliner to refresh itself.
        removeFromCurrentSet: (edit) - Removes selected members of a set from their current set. Current set is the set to which item at the given row belongs to. If no selected items, the item at the given row is removed from its current set.
        renameItem: (edit) - Renames the item at the given row index in the outliner.
        renameSelectedItem: (edit) - Rename the first selected item in the outliner.

If true, the dependency graph is searched upstream for all curves that drive the selected plugs (showing multiple curves for example in a typical driven key setup, where first the driven key curve is encountered, followed by the actual animation curve that drives the source object). If false, only the first curves encountered will be shown. Note that, even if false, multiple curves can be shown if e.g. a blendWeighted node is being used to combine multiple curves.
        sortOrder: (create, edit, query) - Specify how objects are to be sorted.  Current recognised values are "none" for no sorting and "dagName" to sort DAG objects by name. Notes: a) non-DAG objects are always sorted by nodeType and name. b) when sortOrder is set to "dagName", objects cannot be reordered using drag-and-drop, they can however be reparented.
        stateString: (query) - Query only flag. Returns the MEL command that will create an editor to match the current editor state. The returned command string uses the string variable $editorName in place of a specific name.
        transmitFilters: (create, edit, query) - This flag specifies how the selectionConnection is populated when attribute filters are enabled.  If this flag is set to true, then all the attributes that pass the filter will be placed on the selectionConnection.  By default this flag is false.
        ufeFilter: (edit, query) - Specifies what UFE filter attributes should be used for display. This flag must used together with the ufeFilterValue flag to get/set the value of the UFE filter. The first string is the UFE run-time name and the second is the child filter name.

    This command creates an array of color cells. It could be used to to store an retrieve some colors you want to manage during your working session.

    Args:
        actualTotal: (create, query) - Set the actual number of palette entries. This number must be greater than zero, but not be greater than maximum number of palette entries defined by the dimensions flag.
        annotation: (create, edit, query) - Annotate the control with an extra string value.
        backgroundColor: (create, edit, query) - The background color of the control. The arguments correspond to the red, green, and blue color components. Each component ranges in value from 0.0 to 1.0. When setting backgroundColor, the background is automatically enabled, unless enableBackground is also specified with a false value.
        changeCommand: (create, edit) - This command string will be executed when a color in the palette is changed.
        colorEditable: (create, edit, query) - If true then the user can modify the current index's color.
        colorEdited: (create, edit) - This command string will be executed when a color in the palette is edited.
        defineTemplate: (create) - Puts the command in a mode where any other flags and arguments are parsed and added to the command template specified in the argument. They will be used as default arguments in any subsequent invocations of the command when templateName is set as the current template.
        dimensions: (create, query) - Set the dimensions of the array.
        docTag: (create, edit, query) - Add a documentation flag to the control.  The documentation flag has a directory structure. (e.g., -dt render/multiLister/createNode/material)
        dragCallback: (create, edit) - Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:  global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods)  The proc returns a string array that is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type.  Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers CTRL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTRL, 3 == CTRL + SHIFT.  In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form:  def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ):  The values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above.  The other way to specify the callback in Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys "dragControl", "x", "y", "modifiers".  The "dragControl" value is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be "print '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'")
        dropCallback: (create, edit) - Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:  global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int $y, int $type)  The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback. $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link.  In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form:  def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ):  The values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above.  The other way to specify the callback in Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys "dragControl", "dropControl", "messages", "x", "y", "type".  The "dragControl" value is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be "print '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'")
        editable: (create, edit, query) - If true then the user can change the current color.
        enable: (create, edit, query) - The enable state of the control.  By default, this flag is set to true and the control is enabled.  Specify false and the control will appear dimmed or greyed-out indicating it is disabled.
        enableBackground: (create, edit, query) - Enables the background color of the control.
        enableKeyboardFocus: (create, edit, query) - If enabled, the user can navigate to the control with the tab key and select values with the keyboard or mouse. This flag would typically be used to turn off focus support from controls that get it by default, like Edit and List controls. If disabled, text in text fields can still be selected with the mouse but cannot be copied (except on Linux when "Middle Click Paste" is enabled).
        exists: (create) - Returns whether the specified object exists or not. Other flags are ignored.
        fullPathName: (query) - Return the full path name of the widget, which includes all the parents.
        height: (create, edit, query) - The height of the control.  The control will attempt to be this size if it is not overruled by parent layout conditions.
        highlightColor: (create, edit, query) - The highlight color of the control. The arguments correspond to the red, green, and blue color components. Each component ranges in value from 0.0 to 1.0.
        hsvValue: (create, edit, query) - Set a color for a given cell, using HSV format. On query return the color of the current cell.
        isObscured: (query) - Return whether the control can actually be seen by the user. The control will be obscured if its state is invisible, if it is blocked (entirely or partially) by some other control, if it or a parent layout is unmanaged, or if the control's window is invisible or iconified.
        manage: (create, edit, query) - Manage state of the control.  An unmanaged control is not visible, nor does it take up any screen real estate.  All controls are created managed by default.
        noBackground: (create, edit) - Clear/reset the control's background. Passing true means the background should not be drawn at all, false means the background should be drawn.  The state of this flag is inherited by children of this control.
        numberOfPopupMenus: (query) - Return the number of popup menus attached to this control.
        parent: (create, query) - The parent layout for this control.
        popupMenuArray: (query) - Return the names of all the popup menus attached to this control.
        preventOverride: (create, edit, query) - If true, this flag prevents overriding the control's attribute via the control's right mouse button menu.
        redraw: (create, edit) - Forces a redraw of the array
        rgbValue: (create, edit, query) - Set a color for a given cell, using RGB format. On query return the color of the current cell.
        setCurCell: (create, edit, query) - Set the current cell in the array to the given index. Returns the current cell when queried.
        statusBarMessage: (create, edit) - Extra string to display in the status bar when the mouse is over the control.
        topDown: (create) - If this flag is true, it indicates that first entry should appear in top left as opposed to the bottom left.
        transparent: (create, edit, query) - Set a given cell to be the transparent color.  A cell value of -1 indicates that no cell is transparent.  On query returns the current transparent cell.
        useTemplate: (create) - Forces the command to use a command template other than the current one.
        visible: (create, edit, query) - The visible state of the control.  A control is created visible by default.  Note that a control's actual appearance is also dependent on the visible state of its parent layout(s).
        visibleChangeCommand: (create, edit, query) - Command that gets executed when visible state of the control changes.
        width: (create, edit, query) - The width of the control.  The control will attempt to be this size if it is not overruled by parent layout conditions.

    This command allows editing or querying properties of any panels. Not all of the common properites of panels can be used with this command. Flags such as -tearOff and -replacePanel require that you use the explicit panel command. The command 'getPanel -typeOf panelName' will return the explicit type of a panel.

    Args:
        control: (query) - Returns the top level control for this panel. Usually used for getting a parent to attach popup menus. CAUTION: panels may not have controls at times.  This flag can return "" if no control is present.
        copy: (edit) - Makes this panel a copy of the specified panel.  Both panels must be of the same type.
        createString: (edit) - Command string used to create a panel
        defineTemplate: (create) - Puts the command in a mode where any other flags and arguments are parsed and added to the command template specified in the argument. They will be used as default arguments in any subsequent invocations of the command when templateName is set as the current template.
        docTag: (create, edit, query) - Attaches a tag to the Maya panel.
        editString: (edit) - Command string used to edit a panel
        exists: (create) - Returns whether the specified object exists or not. Other flags are ignored.
        init: (create, edit) - Initializes the panel's default state.  This is usually done automatically on file -new and file -open.
        isUnique: (query) - Returns true if only one instance of this panel type is allowed.
        label: (edit, query) - Specifies the user readable label for the panel.
        menuBarRepeatLast: (create, edit, query) - Controls whether clicking on the menu header with the middle mouse button would repeat the last selected menu item.
        menuBarVisible: (create, edit, query) - Controls whether the menu bar for the panel is displayed.
        needsInit: (edit, query) - (Internal) On Edit will mark the panel as requiring initialization. Query will return whether the panel is marked for initialization.  Used during file -new and file -open.
        parent: (create) - Specifies the parent layout for this panel.
        popupMenuProcedure: (edit, query) - Specifies the procedure called for building the panel's popup menu(s). The default value is "buildPanelPopupMenu".  The procedure should take one string argument which is the panel's name.
        replacePanel: (edit) - Will replace the specified panel with this panel.  If the target panel is within the same layout it will perform a swap.
        tearOff: (edit, query) - Will tear off this panel into a separate window with a paneLayout as the parent of the panel. When queried this flag will return if the panel has been torn off into its own window.
        tearOffCopy: (create) - Will create this panel as a torn of copy of the specified source panel.
        tearOffRestore: (create, edit) - Restores panel if it is torn off and focus is given to it. If docked, becomes the active panel in the docked window. This should be the default flag that is added to all panels instead of -to/-tearOff flag which should only be used to tear off the panel.
        unParent: (edit) - Specifies that the panel should be removed from its layout. This (obviously) cannot be used with query.

    This command creates a pane layout.  A pane layout may have any number of children but at any one time only certain children may be visible, as determined by the current layout configuration.  For example a horizontally split pane shows only two children, one on top of the other and a visible separator between the two.  The separator may be moved to vary the size of each pane.  Various other pane configurations are available and all display a moveable separator that define the size of each pane in the layout.

    Args:
        activeFrameThickness: (create, edit, query) - The thickness of the frame drawn around the active frame. Specify an integer value greater than or equal to 0.
        activePane: (create, edit, query) - The active pane has a colored border surrounding it.  Only one pane may be active at any one time.  Using either of the flags -ap/activePane    or -api/activePaneIndex will automatically deactivate the previously active pane.  The argument is the full or short name of the child control.
        activePaneIndex: (create, edit, query) - The active pane index.  The active pane has a colored border surrounding it.  Only one pane may be active at any one time.  Using either of the flags -ap/activePane or -api/activePaneIndex will automatically deactivate the previously active pane.  The argument is an integer value ranging from 1 to 4.  Panes for any particular configuration are numbered clockwise beginning with the pane in the top left corner of the layout.  If any other index is specified then the current active pane is deactivated.
        annotation: (create, edit, query) - Annotate the control with an extra string value.
        backgroundColor: (create, edit, query) - The background color of the control. The arguments correspond to the red, green, and blue color components. Each component ranges in value from 0.0 to 1.0. When setting backgroundColor, the background is automatically enabled, unless enableBackground is also specified with a false value.
        childArray: (query) - Returns a string array of the names of the layout's immediate children.
        configuration: (create, edit, query) - Set the layout configuration for the panes.  Valid values are: "single", "horizontal2", "vertical2", "horizontal3", "vertical3", "top3", "left3", "bottom3", "right3", "horizontal4", "vertical4", "top4", "left4", "bottom4", "right4", "quad"
        defineTemplate: (create) - Puts the command in a mode where any other flags and arguments are parsed and added to the command template specified in the argument. They will be used as default arguments in any subsequent invocations of the command when templateName is set as the current template.
        docTag: (create, edit, query) - Add a documentation flag to the control.  The documentation flag has a directory structure. (e.g., -dt render/multiLister/createNode/material)
        dragCallback: (create, edit) - Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:  global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods)  The proc returns a string array that is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type.  Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers CTRL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTRL, 3 == CTRL + SHIFT.  In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form:  def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ):  The values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above.  The other way to specify the callback in Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys "dragControl", "x", "y", "modifiers".  The "dragControl" value is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be "print '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'")
        dropCallback: (create, edit) - Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:  global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int $y, int $type)  The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback. $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link.  In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form:  def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ):  The values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above.  The other way to specify the callback in Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys "dragControl", "dropControl", "messages", "x", "y", "type".  The "dragControl" value is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be "print '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'")
        enable: (create, edit, query) - The enable state of the control.  By default, this flag is set to true and the control is enabled.  Specify false and the control will appear dimmed or greyed-out indicating it is disabled.
        enableBackground: (create, edit, query) - Enables the background color of the control.
        enableKeyboardFocus: (create, edit, query) - If enabled, the user can navigate to the control with the tab key and select values with the keyboard or mouse. This flag would typically be used to turn off focus support from controls that get it by default, like Edit and List controls. If disabled, text in text fields can still be selected with the mouse but cannot be copied (except on Linux when "Middle Click Paste" is enabled).
        exists: (create) - Returns whether the specified object exists or not. Other flags are ignored.
        fullPathName: (query) - Return the full path name of the widget, which includes all the parents.
        height: (create, edit, query) - The height of the control.  The control will attempt to be this size if it is not overruled by parent layout conditions.
        highlightColor: (create, edit, query) - The highlight color of the control. The arguments correspond to the red, green, and blue color components. Each component ranges in value from 0.0 to 1.0.
        isObscured: (query) - Return whether the control can actually be seen by the user. The control will be obscured if its state is invisible, if it is blocked (entirely or partially) by some other control, if it or a parent layout is unmanaged, or if the control's window is invisible or iconified.
        manage: (create, edit, query) - Manage state of the control.  An unmanaged control is not visible, nor does it take up any screen real estate.  All controls are created managed by default.
        noBackground: (create, edit) - Clear/reset the control's background. Passing true means the background should not be drawn at all, false means the background should be drawn.  The state of this flag is inherited by children of this control.
        numberOfChildren: (query) - Returns in an int the number of immediate children of the layout.
        numberOfPopupMenus: (query) - Return the number of popup menus attached to this control.
        numberOfVisiblePanes: (query) - Return the number of panes visible for the present configuration.
        pane1: (query) - 
        pane2: (query) - 
        pane3: (query) - 
        pane4: (query) - Return the name of the control in the respective pane.
        paneSize: (create, edit, multiuse, query) - The size of a pane in the current pane layout configuration.  The first argument specifies the pane index and is an integer value ranging from 1 to 4.  Panes for any particular configuration are numbered clockwise beginning with the pane in the top left corner of the layout.  The width and height of the pane are specified by the last two arguments.  Both are integer values and they indicate the percentage of the total pane layout size rather that the number of pixels.
        paneUnderPointer: (query) - Return the name of the child occupying the pane that the pointer is currently over.  An empty string is returned if the pointer is not over a pane.
        parent: (create, query) - The parent layout for this control.
        popupMenuArray: (query) - Return the names of all the popup menus attached to this control.
        preventOverride: (create, edit, query) - If true, this flag prevents overriding the control's attribute via the control's right mouse button menu.
        separatorMovedCommand: (create, edit) - This command executed when the pane separators are moved.
        separatorThickness: (create, edit, query) - The thickness of the separators between the panes. Specify an integer value greater than 0. This flag has no effect on Windows systems.
        setPane: (create, edit, multiuse) - This flag allows you to put a child of this layout in a particular pane.  The first argument is the full or short name of the control.  The second argument is an integer value ranging from 1 to 4.  Panes for any particular configuration are numbered clockwise beginning with the pane in the top left corner of the layout.
        staticHeightPane: (create, edit) - Set a pane to have a static height, i.e. its height will not change when the layout is dynamically resized. Only one pane can be set to have a static height at one time. This state will be retained even if another child is switched into the pane. Specify 0 to set a pane back to the default state. Any state will be lost if the pane configuration is changed.
        staticWidthPane: (create, edit) - Set a pane to have a static width, i.e. its width will not change when the layout is dynamically resized. Only one pane can be set to have a static width at one time. This state will be retained even if another child is switched into the pane. Specify 0 to set a pane back to the default state. Any state will be lost if the pane configuration is changed.
        statusBarMessage: (create, edit) - Extra string to display in the status bar when the mouse is over the control.
        useTemplate: (create) - Forces the command to use a command template other than the current one.
        visible: (create, edit, query) - The visible state of the control.  A control is created visible by default.  Note that a control's actual appearance is also dependent on the visible state of its parent layout(s).
        visibleChangeCommand: (create, edit, query) - Command that gets executed when visible state of the control changes.
        width: (create, edit, query) - The width of the control.  The control will attempt to be this size if it is not overruled by parent layout conditions.

    This command creates a static image.

    Args:
        annotation: (create, edit, query) - Annotate the control with an extra string value.
        backgroundColor: (create, edit, query) - The background color of the control. The arguments correspond to the red, green, and blue color components. Each component ranges in value from 0.0 to 1.0. When setting backgroundColor, the background is automatically enabled, unless enableBackground is also specified with a false value.
        defineTemplate: (create) - Puts the command in a mode where any other flags and arguments are parsed and added to the command template specified in the argument. They will be used as default arguments in any subsequent invocations of the command when templateName is set as the current template.
        docTag: (create, edit, query) - Add a documentation flag to the control.  The documentation flag has a directory structure. (e.g., -dt render/multiLister/createNode/material)
        dragCallback: (create, edit) - Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:  global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods)  The proc returns a string array that is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type.  Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers CTRL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTRL, 3 == CTRL + SHIFT.  In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form:  def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ):  The values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above.  The other way to specify the callback in Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys "dragControl", "x", "y", "modifiers".  The "dragControl" value is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be "print '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'")
        dropCallback: (create, edit) - Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:  global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int $y, int $type)  The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback. $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link.  In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form:  def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ):  The values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above.  The other way to specify the callback in Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys "dragControl", "dropControl", "messages", "x", "y", "type".  The "dragControl" value is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be "print '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'")
        enable: (create, edit, query) - The enable state of the control.  By default, this flag is set to true and the control is enabled.  Specify false and the control will appear dimmed or greyed-out indicating it is disabled.
        enableBackground: (create, edit, query) - Enables the background color of the control.
        enableKeyboardFocus: (create, edit, query) - If enabled, the user can navigate to the control with the tab key and select values with the keyboard or mouse. This flag would typically be used to turn off focus support from controls that get it by default, like Edit and List controls. If disabled, text in text fields can still be selected with the mouse but cannot be copied (except on Linux when "Middle Click Paste" is enabled).
        exists: (create) - Returns whether the specified object exists or not. Other flags are ignored.
        fullPathName: (query) - Return the full path name of the widget, which includes all the parents.
        height: (create, edit, query) - The height of the control.  The control will attempt to be this size if it is not overruled by parent layout conditions.
        highlightColor: (create, edit, query) - The highlight color of the control. The arguments correspond to the red, green, and blue color components. Each component ranges in value from 0.0 to 1.0.
        image: (create, edit, query) - Sets the image given the .xpm file name.
        isObscured: (query) - Return whether the control can actually be seen by the user. The control will be obscured if its state is invisible, if it is blocked (entirely or partially) by some other control, if it or a parent layout is unmanaged, or if the control's window is invisible or iconified.
        manage: (create, edit, query) - Manage state of the control.  An unmanaged control is not visible, nor does it take up any screen real estate.  All controls are created managed by default.
        noBackground: (create, edit) - Clear/reset the control's background. Passing true means the background should not be drawn at all, false means the background should be drawn.  The state of this flag is inherited by children of this control.
        numberOfPopupMenus: (query) - Return the number of popup menus attached to this control.
        parent: (create, query) - The parent layout for this control.
        popupMenuArray: (query) - Return the names of all the popup menus attached to this control.
        preventOverride: (create, edit, query) - If true, this flag prevents overriding the control's attribute via the control's right mouse button menu.
        statusBarMessage: (create, edit) - Extra string to display in the status bar when the mouse is over the control.
        tile: (create, edit, query) - If true, the picture is tiled to fill the picture area. False by default. (Windows only flag)
        useTemplate: (create) - Forces the command to use a command template other than the current one.
        visible: (create, edit, query) - The visible state of the control.  A control is created visible by default.  Note that a control's actual appearance is also dependent on the visible state of its parent layout(s).
        visibleChangeCommand: (create, edit, query) - Command that gets executed when visible state of the control changes.
        width: (create, edit, query) - The width of the control.  The control will attempt to be this size if it is not overruled by parent layout conditions.

        dragCallback: (create, edit) - Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:  global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods)  The proc returns a string array that is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type.  Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers CTRL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTRL, 3 == CTRL + SHIFT.  In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form:  def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ):  The values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above.  The other way to specify the callback in Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys "dragControl", "x", "y", "modifiers".  The "dragControl" value is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be "print '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'")
        dropCallback: (create, edit) - Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:  global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int $y, int $type)  The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback. $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link.  In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form:  def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ):  The values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above.  The other way to specify the callback in Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys "dragControl", "dropControl", "messages", "x", "y", "type".  The "dragControl" value is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be "print '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'")
        editable: (create, edit, query) - The edit state of the radio button.  By default, this flag is set to true and the radio button value may be changed by clicking on it.  If false then the radio button is 'read only' and can not be clicked on. The value of the radio button can always be changed with the -sl/select flag regardless of the state of the -ed/editable flag.
        enable: (create, edit, query) - The enable state of the control.  By default, this flag is set to true and the control is enabled.  Specify false and the control will appear dimmed or greyed-out indicating it is disabled.
        enableBackground: (create, edit, query) - Enables the background color of the control.
        enableKeyboardFocus: (create, edit, query) - If enabled, the user can navigate to the control with the tab key and select values with the keyboard or mouse. This flag would typically be used to turn off focus support from controls that get it by default, like Edit and List controls. If disabled, text in text fields can still be selected with the mouse but cannot be copied (except on Linux when "Middle Click Paste" is enabled).
        exists: (create) - Returns whether the specified object exists or not. Other flags are ignored.
        fullPathName: (query) - Return the full path name of the widget, which includes all the parents.
        height: (create, edit, query) - The height of the control.  The control will attempt to be this size if it is not overruled by parent layout conditions.
        highlightColor: (create, edit, query) - The highlight color of the control. The arguments correspond to the red, green, and blue color components. Each component ranges in value from 0.0 to 1.0.
        isObscured: (query) - Return whether the control can actually be seen by the user. The control will be obscured if its state is invisible, if it is blocked (entirely or partially) by some other control, if it or a parent layout is unmanaged, or if the control's window is invisible or iconified.
        label: (create, edit, query) - The label text.  The default label is the name of the control.
        manage: (create, edit, query) - Manage state of the control.  An unmanaged control is not visible, nor does it take up any screen real estate.  All controls are created managed by default.
        noBackground: (create, edit) - Clear/reset the control's background. Passing true means the background should not be drawn at all, false means the background should be drawn.  The state of this flag is inherited by children of this control.
        numberOfPopupMenus: (query) - Return the number of popup menus attached to this control.
        offCommand: (create, edit) - Command executed when the radio button is turned off.
        onCommand: (create, edit) - Command executed when the radio button is turned on.
        parent: (create, query) - The parent layout for this control.
        popupMenuArray: (query) - Return the names of all the popup menus attached to this control.
        preventOverride: (create, edit, query) - If true, this flag prevents overriding the control's attribute via the control's right mouse button menu.
        recomputeSize: (create, edit, query) - If true then the control will recompute it's size to just fit the size of the label.  If false then the control size will remain fixed as you change the size of the label.  The default value of this flag is true.
        select: (create, edit, query) - Select the radio button.
        statusBarMessage: (create, edit) - Extra string to display in the status bar when the mouse is over the control.
        useTemplate: (create) - Forces the command to use a command template other than the current one.
        visible: (create, edit, query) - The visible state of the control.  A control is created visible by default.  Note that a control's actual appearance is also dependent on the visible state of its parent layout(s).
        visibleChangeCommand: (create, edit, query) - Command that gets executed when visible state of the control changes.
        width: (create, edit, query) - The width of the control.  The control will attempt to be this size if it is not overruled by parent layout conditions.

Each component ranges in value from 0.0 to 1.0. When setting backgroundColor, the background is automatically enabled, unless enableBackground is also specified with a false value.
        changedCommand: (create, edit) - script to be executed when the range changes

They will be used as default arguments in any subsequent invocations of the command when templateName is set as the current template.

The MEL version of the callback is of the form:  global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods)  The proc returns a string array that is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type.  Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers CTRL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTRL, 3 == CTRL + SHIFT.  In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form:  def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ):  The values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above.  The other way to specify the callback in Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys "dragControl", "x", "y", "modifiers".  The "dragControl" value is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be "print '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'")
        dropCallback: (create, edit) - Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:  global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int $y, int $type)  The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback. $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link.  In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form:  def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ):  The values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above.  The other way to specify the callback in Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys "dragControl", "dropControl", "messages", "x", "y", "type".  The "dragControl" value is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be "print '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'")
        enable: (create, edit, query) - The enable state of the control.  By default, this flag is set to true and the control is enabled.  Specify false and the control will appear dimmed or greyed-out indicating it is disabled.
        enableBackground: (create, edit, query) - Enables the background color of the control.
        enableKeyboardFocus: (create, edit, query) - If enabled, the user can navigate to the control with the tab key and select values with the keyboard or mouse. This flag would typically be used to turn off focus support from controls that get it by default, like Edit and List controls. If disabled, text in text fields can still be selected with the mouse but cannot be copied (except on Linux when "Middle Click Paste" is enabled).
        exists: (create) - Returns whether the specified object exists or not. Other flags are ignored.
        fullPathName: (query) - Return the full path name of the widget, which includes all the parents.
        height: (create, edit, query) - The height of the control.  The control will attempt to be this size if it is not overruled by parent layout conditions.
        highlightColor: (create, edit, query) - The highlight color of the control. The arguments correspond to the red, green, and blue color components. Each component ranges in value from 0.0 to 1.0.
        isObscured: (query) - Return whether the control can actually be seen by the user. The control will be obscured if its state is invisible, if it is blocked (entirely or partially) by some other control, if it or a parent layout is unmanaged, or if the control's window is invisible or iconified.
        manage: (create, edit, query) - Manage state of the control.  An unmanaged control is not visible, nor does it take up any screen real estate.  All controls are created managed by default.
        maxRange: (create, edit, query) - Controls the max range displayable in the control
        minRange: (create, edit, query) - Controls the max range displayable in the control
        noBackground: (create, edit) - Clear/reset the control's background. Passing true means the background should not be drawn at all, false means the background should be drawn.  The state of this flag is inherited by children of this control.
        numberOfPopupMenus: (query) - Return the number of popup menus attached to this control.
        parent: (create, query) - The parent layout for this control.
        popupMenuArray: (query) - Return the names of all the popup menus attached to this control.

The offsets applied are based on the attachments specified with the -columnAttach1 flag. Ignored if there isn't exactly one column.
        columnOffset2: (create) - Used in conjunction with the -columnAttach2 flag.  If that flag is not used then this flag will be ignored.  Sets the offset for both columns.

        defineTemplate: (create) - Puts the command in a mode where any other flags and arguments are parsed and added to the command template specified in the argument. They will be used as default arguments in any subsequent invocations of the command when templateName is set as the current template.
        docTag: (create, edit, query) - Add a documentation flag to the control.  The documentation flag has a directory structure. (e.g., -dt render/multiLister/createNode/material)
        dragCallback: (create, edit) - Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:  global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods)  The proc returns a string array that is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type.  Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers CTRL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTRL, 3 == CTRL + SHIFT.  In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form:  def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ):  The values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above.  The other way to specify the callback in Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys "dragControl", "x", "y", "modifiers".  The "dragControl" value is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be "print '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'")
        dropCallback: (create, edit) - Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:  global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int $y, int $type)  The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback. $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link.  In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form:  def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ):  The values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above.  The other way to specify the callback in Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys "dragControl", "dropControl", "messages", "x", "y", "type".  The "dragControl" value is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be "print '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'")
        enable: (create, edit, query) - The enable state of the control.  By default, this flag is set to true and the control is enabled.  Specify false and the control will appear dimmed or greyed-out indicating it is disabled.
        enableBackground: (create, edit, query) - Enables the background color of the control.
        enableKeyboardFocus: (create, edit, query) - If enabled, the user can navigate to the control with the tab key and select values with the keyboard or mouse. This flag would typically be used to turn off focus support from controls that get it by default, like Edit and List controls. If disabled, text in text fields can still be selected with the mouse but cannot be copied (except on Linux when "Middle Click Paste" is enabled).
        exists: (create) - Returns whether the specified object exists or not. Other flags are ignored.
        fullPathName: (query) - Return the full path name of the widget, which includes all the parents.
        height: (create, edit, query) - The height of the control.  The control will attempt to be this size if it is not overruled by parent layout conditions.
        highlightColor: (create, edit, query) - The highlight color of the control. The arguments correspond to the red, green, and blue color components. Each component ranges in value from 0.0 to 1.0.
        isObscured: (query) - Return whether the control can actually be seen by the user. The control will be obscured if its state is invisible, if it is blocked (entirely or partially) by some other control, if it or a parent layout is unmanaged, or if the control's window is invisible or iconified.
        manage: (create, edit, query) - Manage state of the control.  An unmanaged control is not visible, nor does it take up any screen real estate.  All controls are created managed by default.
        noBackground: (create, edit) - Clear/reset the control's background. Passing true means the background should not be drawn at all, false means the background should be drawn.  The state of this flag is inherited by children of this control.
        numberOfChildren: (query) - Returns in an int the number of immediate children of the layout.
        numberOfColumns: (create, query) - Number of columns in the row.  The specified number of columns must be a value greater than 0.
        numberOfPopupMenus: (query) - Return the number of popup menus attached to this control.
        parent: (create, query) - The parent layout for this control.
        popupMenuArray: (query) - Return the names of all the popup menus attached to this control.
        preventOverride: (create, edit, query) - If true, this flag prevents overriding the control's attribute via the control's right mouse button menu.
        rowAttach: (create, edit, multiuse) - Vertically attach a particular column.  The first argument is a 1-based index specifying the column.  The second argument is the attachment, valid values are "top", "bottom", and "both".  The third argument is the offset value.
        statusBarMessage: (create, edit) - Extra string to display in the status bar when the mouse is over the control.
        useTemplate: (create) - Forces the command to use a command template other than the current one.
        visible: (create, edit, query) - The visible state of the control.  A control is created visible by default.  Note that a control's actual appearance is also dependent on the visible state of its parent layout(s).
        visibleChangeCommand: (create, edit, query) - Command that gets executed when visible state of the control changes.
        width: (create, edit, query) - The width of the control.  The control will attempt to be this size if it is not overruled by parent layout conditions.

        control: (query) - Returns the top level control for this panel. Usually used for getting a parent to attach popup menus. CAUTION: panels may not have controls at times.  This flag can return "" if no control is present.
        copy: (edit) - Makes this panel a copy of the specified panel.  Both panels must be of the same type.
        createString: (edit) - Command string used to create a panel
        defineTemplate: (create) - Puts the command in a mode where any other flags and arguments are parsed and added to the command template specified in the argument. They will be used as default arguments in any subsequent invocations of the command when templateName is set as the current template.
        docTag: (create, edit, query) - Attaches a tag to the Maya panel.
        editString: (edit) - Command string used to edit a panel
        exists: (create) - Returns whether the specified object exists or not. Other flags are ignored.
        init: (create, edit) - Initializes the panel's default state.  This is usually done automatically on file -new and file -open.
        isUnique: (query) - Returns true if only one instance of this panel type is allowed.
        label: (edit, query) - Specifies the user readable label for the panel.
        menuBarRepeatLast: (create, edit, query) - Controls whether clicking on the menu header with the middle mouse button would repeat the last selected menu item.
        menuBarVisible: (create, edit, query) - Controls whether the menu bar for the panel is displayed.
        needsInit: (edit, query) - (Internal) On Edit will mark the panel as requiring initialization. Query will return whether the panel is marked for initialization.  Used during file -new and file -open.
        parent: (create) - Specifies the parent layout for this panel.
        popupMenuProcedure: (edit, query) - Specifies the procedure called for building the panel's popup menu(s). The default value is "buildPanelPopupMenu".  The procedure should take one string argument which is the panel's name.
        replacePanel: (edit) - Will replace the specified panel with this panel.  If the target panel is within the same layout it will perform a swap.
        tearOff: (edit, query) - Will tear off this panel into a separate window with a paneLayout as the parent of the panel. When queried this flag will return if the panel has been torn off into its own window.
        tearOffCopy: (create) - Will create this panel as a torn of copy of the specified source panel.
        tearOffRestore: (create, edit) - Restores panel if it is torn off and focus is given to it. If docked, becomes the active panel in the docked window. This should be the default flag that is added to all panels instead of -to/-tearOff flag which should only be used to tear off the panel.
        type: (create, query) - This flag specifies the type of scripted panel to create.
        unParent: (edit) - Specifies that the panel should be removed from its layout. This (obviously) cannot be used with query.
        useTemplate: (create) - Forces the command to use a command template other than the current one.

    This command defines the callbacks for a type of scripted panel.  The panel type created by this command is then used when creating a scripted panel.  See also the 'scriptedPanel' command.

    Args:
        addCallback: (create, edit, query) - This flag specifies the callback procedure for adding the panel to a particular control layout.  The parent layout is guaranteed to be the current default layout when the proc is called.  If its name is required then it can be queried with 'setParent -q'.  Any editors should be parented here. global proc procName (string $panelName) { .... }
        copyStateCallback: (create, edit, query) - This flag specifies the callback procedure for copying the state of the panel when a tear-off copy of the panel is made.  The callback proc has the form: global proc procName (string $panelName, string $newPanelName) { .... } This procedure will be executed immediately after the addCallback procedure has finished executing. At that point, the copied panel will be fully created and accessible to facilitate copying of panel settings. Note: the addCallback procedure is called after the createCallback procedure has been called.
        createCallback: (create, edit, query) - This flag specifies the callback procedure for initially creating the panel object.  No UI should be created here.  Any editors owned by the panel should be created here unparented. The callback proc has the form: global proc procName (string $panelName) { .... }
        customView: (create, edit, query) - This flag specifies if this view is a custom 3d view for MPx3dModelView types. This flag should only be used for MPx3dModelView types.
        defineTemplate: (create) - Puts the command in a mode where any other flags and arguments are parsed and added to the command template specified in the argument. They will be used as default arguments in any subsequent invocations of the command when templateName is set as the current template.
        deleteCallback: (create, edit, query) - This flag specifies the callback procedure for final deletion of the panel.  The callback proc has the form: global proc procName (string $panelName) { .... }
        exists: (create) - Returns whether the specified object exists or not. Other flags are ignored.
        hotkeyCtxClient: (create, edit, query) - This flag is used to specify the name of the hotkey context client for this panel type. By default, it is the same as the panel type.
        initCallback: (create, edit, query) - This flag specifies the callback procedure for the initialize callback.  This will be called on file -new and file -open to give the panel an opportunity to re-initialize to a starting state, if required. The panel may be parented or unparented at this time. The callback proc has the form: global proc procName (string $panelName) { .... }
        label: (create, edit, query) - Label for the panel
        obsolete: (create, edit, query) - This flag specifies that this type is no longer used in Maya.
        removeCallback: (create, edit, query) - This flag specifies the callback procedure for removing the panel from its current control layout.  Any editors should be unparented here. The callback proc has the form: global proc procName (string $panelName) { .... }
        retainOnFileOpen: (create, edit, query) - This flag specifies if panels of this type should be retained after restoring panel cofiguration during file open. Default value is false.
        saveStateCallback: (create, edit, query) - This flag specifies the callback procedure for saving the state of the panel.  The callback proc has the form: global proc string procName (string $panelName) { .... } Note that the proc returns a string.  This string will be executed after the createCallback has been called to facilitate restoring the panel state.
        unique: (create, edit, query) - This flag specifies if only one instance of this type of panel can exist at a given time.

    This command creates/edits/queries the script table control.

    Args:
        afterCellChangedCmd: (create, edit) - Sets the script to call after the value of a cell has been changed. The procedure is called with 2 integer arguments specifying the row and column for which the value was changed. The 3rd argument is the string which was entered into that cell. The procedure does not need to return any value. The row and column numbers passed in are 1-based (i.e. (1,1) is the upper left cell). The procedure should be of the form:  global proc procedureName(int $row, int $column, string $value)
        annotation: (create, edit, query) - Annotate the control with an extra string value.
        backgroundColor: (create, edit, query) - The background color of the control. The arguments correspond to the red, green, and blue color components. Each component ranges in value from 0.0 to 1.0. When setting backgroundColor, the background is automatically enabled, unless enableBackground is also specified with a false value.
        cellBackgroundColorCommand: (create, edit) - Sets the script to call when it requires the background color of a cell. The procedure is called with 2 integer arguments specifying the row and column for which the value is required. The procedure should return an array of ints which is the RGB color value for the cell. The row and column numbers passed in are 1-based (i.e. (1,1) is the upper left cell). The procedure should be of the form:  global proc int[] procedureName(int $row, int $column) { return {255,0,0}; // return Red as cell background color }
        cellChangedCmd: (create, edit) - Sets the script to call when somebody has changed the value of a cell. The procedure is called with 2 integer arguments specifying the row and column for which the value was changed. The 3rd argument is the string which was entered into that cell. The procedure should return an integer value which indicates whether that value should be accepted (return 1 if yes, and 0 if no). The row and column numbers passed in are 1-based (i.e. (1,1) is the upper left cell). The procedure should be of the form:  global proc int procedureName(int $row, int $column, string $value)
        cellForegroundColorCommand: (create, edit) - Sets the script to call when it requires the foreground color of a cell. The procedure is called with 2 integer arguments specifying the row and column for which the value is required. The procedure should return an array of ints which is the RGB color value for the cell. The row and column numbers passed in are 1-based (i.e. (1,1) is the upper left cell). The procedure should be of the form:  global proc int[] procedureName(int $row, int $column) { return {0,0,0}; // return Black as Text color }
        cellIndex: (edit, query) - used with cellValue , to give the index of row and column This flag and its argument must be passed to the command before the -q flag (see examples).       In query mode, this flag needs a value.
        cellValue: (edit, query) - query and set the cell value on the table by the index of row and column referred in flag -cellIndex. In edit mode, if flag -multiEditEnabled is True and any cell is selected, the flag -cellIndex is not used and the selected cells will be changed.
        clearRow: (edit) - Clear the contents for all the cells on the specified row. Any procedure specified by the -gcc flag will be called to populate the cleared cells The row number is 1-based (i.e. the first row is 1 not 0).
        clearTable: (edit) - Clears the contents of all the cells in the table. Any procedure specified by the -gcc flag will be called to populate the cleared cells
        columnFilter: (create, edit) - Filter the specified column with the string value provided. Set filter to columns 0 will apply the filter to all columns. The filter is case insensitive and support wildcards. Wildcard Matching: Wildcard matching is much simpler than full regexps and has only four features: c	Any character represents itself apart from those mentioned below. Thus c matches the character c. ?	Matches any single character. It is the same as . in full regexps. *	Matches zero or more of any characters. It is the same as .* in full regexps. [...]	Sets of characters can be represented in square brackets, similar to full regexps. Within the character class, backslash has no special meaning. (i.e. you can search for "MyValue" with "y*u" or "??Val??" or "[MyThe]Value" or any letters in "MyValue" The column number is 1-based (i.e. the first row is 1 not 0).
        columnWidth: (create, edit, multiuse) - Set the width of the specified column The column number is 1-based (ie. the first column is 1 not 0).
        columns: (create, edit, query) - Set the number of columns in the table
        defineTemplate: (create) - Puts the command in a mode where any other flags and arguments are parsed and added to the command template specified in the argument. They will be used as default arguments in any subsequent invocations of the command when templateName is set as the current template.
        deleteRow: (edit) - Delete the specified row The row number is 1-based (i.e. the first row is 1 not 0).
        docTag: (create, edit, query) - Add a documentation flag to the control.  The documentation flag has a directory structure. (e.g., -dt render/multiLister/createNode/material)
        dragCallback: (create, edit) - Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:  global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods)  The proc returns a string array that is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type.  Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers CTRL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTRL, 3 == CTRL + SHIFT.  In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form:  def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ):  The values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above.  The other way to specify the callback in Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys "dragControl", "x", "y", "modifiers".  The "dragControl" value is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be "print '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'")
        dropCallback: (create, edit) - Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:  global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int $y, int $type)  The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback. $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link.  In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form:  def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ):  The values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above.  The other way to specify the callback in Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys "dragControl", "dropControl", "messages", "x", "y", "type".  The "dragControl" value is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be "print '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'")
        editable: (create, edit, query) - The edit state of the table. By default, this flag is set to true, and the table can be edited. If false, then the table is 'read only' and cannot be typed into.
        enable: (create, edit, query) - The enable state of the control.  By default, this flag is set to true and the control is enabled.  Specify false and the control will appear dimmed or greyed-out indicating it is disabled.
        enableBackground: (create, edit, query) - Enables the background color of the control.
        enableKeyboardFocus: (create, edit, query) - If enabled, the user can navigate to the control with the tab key and select values with the keyboard or mouse. This flag would typically be used to turn off focus support from controls that get it by default, like Edit and List controls. If disabled, text in text fields can still be selected with the mouse but cannot be copied (except on Linux when "Middle Click Paste" is enabled).
        excludingHeaders: (query) - when querying the count for the rows or the columns , the number returned will not include the headers
        exists: (create) - Returns whether the specified object exists or not. Other flags are ignored.
        fullPathName: (query) - Return the full path name of the widget, which includes all the parents.
        getCellCmd: (create, edit) - Sets the script to call when it requires the contents of a cell. The procedure is called with 2 integer arguments specifying the row and column for which the value is required. The procedure should return a string which is the value for the cell. The row and column numbers passed in are 1-based (ie. (1,1) is the upper left cell). The procedure should be of the form:  global proc string procedureName(int $row, int $column)
        height: (create, edit, query) - The height of the control.  The control will attempt to be this size if it is not overruled by parent layout conditions.
        highlightColor: (create, edit, query) - The highlight color of the control. The arguments correspond to the red, green, and blue color components. Each component ranges in value from 0.0 to 1.0.
        insertRow: (edit) - Insert an empty row before the specified row. Any procedure specified by the -gcc flag will be called to populate the new new cells. The row number is 1-based (i.e. the first row is 1 not 0).
        isObscured: (query) - Return whether the control can actually be seen by the user. The control will be obscured if its state is invisible, if it is blocked (entirely or partially) by some other control, if it or a parent layout is unmanaged, or if the control's window is invisible or iconified.
        label: (create, edit, multiuse) - Set the label of the specified column. The column number is 1-based (ie. the first column is 1 not 0).
        manage: (create, edit, query) - Manage state of the control.  An unmanaged control is not visible, nor does it take up any screen real estate.  All controls are created managed by default.
        multiEditEnabled: (create, edit, query) - True: scriptTable support multi-editing function
        noBackground: (create, edit) - Clear/reset the control's background. Passing true means the background should not be drawn at all, false means the background should be drawn.  The state of this flag is inherited by children of this control.
        numberOfPopupMenus: (query) - Return the number of popup menus attached to this control.
        parent: (create, query) - The parent layout for this control.
        popupMenuArray: (query) - Return the names of all the popup menus attached to this control.
        preventOverride: (create, edit, query) - If true, this flag prevents overriding the control's attribute via the control's right mouse button menu.
        rowHeight: (create, edit, query) - Sets the height for each row in the scriptTable
        rows: (create, edit, query) - Set the number of rows in the table
        rowsRemovedCmd: (create, edit) - Sets the script to call after rows are removed by pressing 'delete' or 'backspace' key. The procedure is called with one argument specifying that selected rows have been removed. The rows passed in are 1-based. The procedure should be of the form:  global proc procedureName(int $rows[])
        rowsToBeRemovedCmd: (create, edit) - Sets the script to call when 'delete' or 'backspace' key is pressed. The procedure is called with one argument specifying the selected rows to be removed. The procedure should return an integer value which indicates whether the selected rows should be removed (return 1 if yes, and 0 if no). The rows passed in are 1-based. The procedure should be of the form:  global proc int procedureName(int $rows[])
        selectedCells: (edit, query) - Select the cells or return  the cells currently selected. This returns a list of indices, the first of each pair is the row, the second is the column, repeated for each cell selected The returned cell numbers are 1-based (ie. the first row is 1 not 0, the first column is 1 not 0).
        selectedColumns: (edit, query) - select the columns or return the columns currently selected. This returns a list of indices of each column completely selected The returned column numbers are 1-based
        selectedRow: (query) - The current row selected. The returned row number is 1-based (ie. the first row is 1 not 0).
        selectedRows: (edit, query) - In edit mode, select the rows given as argument. In query mode, return a list of indices of completely selected rows. The row numbers are 1-based
        selectionBehavior: (create, edit, query) - Set the selection behavior, valid values are from 0 to 2 (inclusive) 0 - Selecting single items. 1 - Selecting only rows. 2 - Selecting only columns.
        selectionChangedCmd: (create, edit) - Sets the script to call when a complete selection operation triggered by the user has occurred successfully. The script does not pass any parameters and does not need to return any value (i.e. It is simply a notification mechanism).
        selectionMode: (create, edit, query) - Set the selection Mode, valid values are from 0 to 4 (inclusive) 0 - Items cannot be selected. 1 - When the user selects an item, any already-selected item becomes unselected, and the user cannot unselect the selected item by clicking on it. 2 - When the user selects an item in the usual way, the selection status of that item is toggled and the other items are left alone. Multiple items can be toggled by dragging the mouse over them. 3 - When the user selects an item in the usual way, the selection is cleared and the new item selected. However, if the user presses the Ctrl key when clicking on an item, the clicked item gets toggled and all other items are left untouched. If the user presses the Shift key while clicking on an item, all items between the current item and the clicked item are selected or unselected, depending on the state of the clicked item. Multiple items can be selected by dragging the mouse over them. 4 - When the user selects an item in the usual way, the selection is cleared and the new item selected. However, if the user presses the Shift key while clicking on an item, all items between the current item and the clicked item are selected or unselected, depending on the state of the clicked item.
        sortEnabled: (create, edit, query) - enable scriptTable sorted by column default value is false and the whole row will be sorted
        statusBarMessage: (create, edit) - Extra string to display in the status bar when the mouse is over the control.

        underPointerRow: (query) - The row under the pointer. The returned row number is 1-based (i.e. the first row is 1 not 0).
        useDoubleClickEdit: (create, edit, query) - this controls the cell edit mode False: Click in the cell to select (in Row selection, the last cell of the row is edited, in Column selection, the last cell of the column is edited)(default)  True:  Clicked in cell is edited when double-clicked only
        useTemplate: (create) - Forces the command to use a command template other than the current one.
        visible: (create, edit, query) - The visible state of the control.  A control is created visible by default.  Note that a control's actual appearance is also dependent on the visible state of its parent layout(s).
        visibleChangeCommand: (create, edit, query) - Command that gets executed when visible state of the control changes.
        width: (create, edit, query) - The width of the control.  The control will attempt to be this size if it is not overruled by parent layout conditions.

        defineTemplate: (create) - Puts the command in a mode where any other flags and arguments are parsed and added to the command template specified in the argument. They will be used as default arguments in any subsequent invocations of the command when templateName is set as the current template.
        docTag: (create, edit, query) - Add a documentation flag to the control.  The documentation flag has a directory structure. (e.g., -dt render/multiLister/createNode/material)
        dragCallback: (create, edit) - Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:  global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods)  The proc returns a string array that is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type.  Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers CTRL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTRL, 3 == CTRL + SHIFT.  In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form:  def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ):  The values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above.  The other way to specify the callback in Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys "dragControl", "x", "y", "modifiers".  The "dragControl" value is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be "print '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'")
        dropCallback: (create, edit) - Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:  global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int $y, int $type)  The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback. $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link.  In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form:  def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ):  The values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above.  The other way to specify the callback in Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys "dragControl", "dropControl", "messages", "x", "y", "type".  The "dragControl" value is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be "print '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'")
        editable: (create, edit, query) - The edit state of the field.  By default, this flag is set to true and the field value may be changed by typing into it. If false then the field is 'read only' and can not be typed into. The text in the field can always be changed with the -tx/text flag regardless of the state of the -ed/editable flag.
        enable: (create, edit, query) - The enable state of the control.  By default, this flag is set to true and the control is enabled.  Specify false and the control will appear dimmed or greyed-out indicating it is disabled.
        enableBackground: (create, edit, query) - Enables the background color of the control.
        enableKeyboardFocus: (create, edit, query) - If enabled, the user can navigate to the control with the tab key and select values with the keyboard or mouse. This flag would typically be used to turn off focus support from controls that get it by default, like Edit and List controls. If disabled, text in text fields can still be selected with the mouse but cannot be copied (except on Linux when "Middle Click Paste" is enabled).
        enterCommand: (create, edit) - Command executed when the enter key is pressed. This applies to the enter key on the numeric keypad only.
        exists: (create) - Returns whether the specified object exists or not. Other flags are ignored.
        font: (create, edit, query) - The font for the text.  Valid values are "boldLabelFont", "smallBoldLabelFont", "tinyBoldLabelFont", "plainLabelFont", "smallPlainLabelFont", "obliqueLabelFont", "smallObliqueLabelFont", "fixedWidthFont" and "smallFixedWidthFont".
        fontPointSize: (create, edit, query) - The font point size for the text.
        fullPathName: (query) - Return the full path name of the widget, which includes all the parents.
        height: (create, edit, query) - The height of the control.  The control will attempt to be this size if it is not overruled by parent layout conditions.
        highlightColor: (create, edit, query) - The highlight color of the control. The arguments correspond to the red, green, and blue color components. Each component ranges in value from 0.0 to 1.0.
        insertText: (create, edit) - Insert text into the field at the current insertion position (specified by the -ip/insertionPosition flag).
        insertionPosition: (create, edit, query) - The insertion position for inserted text.  This is a 1 based value where position 1 specifies the beginning of the field.  Position 0 may be used to specify the end of the field.
        isObscured: (query) - Return whether the control can actually be seen by the user. The control will be obscured if its state is invisible, if it is blocked (entirely or partially) by some other control, if it or a parent layout is unmanaged, or if the control's window is invisible or iconified.
        keyPressCommand: (create, edit) - Command executed when any key is pressed.
        manage: (create, edit, query) - Manage state of the control.  An unmanaged control is not visible, nor does it take up any screen real estate.  All controls are created managed by default.
        noBackground: (create, edit) - Clear/reset the control's background. Passing true means the background should not be drawn at all, false means the background should be drawn.  The state of this flag is inherited by children of this control.
        numberOfLines: (query) - Number of lines in the scroll field.
        numberOfPopupMenus: (query) - Return the number of popup menus attached to this control.
        parent: (create, query) - The parent layout for this control.
        popupMenuArray: (query) - Return the names of all the popup menus attached to this control.
        preventOverride: (create, edit, query) - If true, this flag prevents overriding the control's attribute via the control's right mouse button menu.
        selection: (query) - The selected text in the field.  An empty string is returned if there is no selected text.
        statusBarMessage: (create, edit) - Extra string to display in the status bar when the mouse is over the control.
        text: (create, edit, query) - The field text.
        useTemplate: (create) - Forces the command to use a command template other than the current one.
        visible: (create, edit, query) - The visible state of the control.  A control is created visible by default.  Note that a control's actual appearance is also dependent on the visible state of its parent layout(s).
        visibleChangeCommand: (create, edit, query) - Command that gets executed when visible state of the control changes.
        width: (create, edit, query) - The width of the control.  The control will attempt to be this size if it is not overruled by parent layout conditions.
        wordWrap: (create) - Specify true to break lines at spaces, tabs, or newlines.  Text will continue on the following line.  A value of false will not break text between words, in which case text may disappear beyond the edge of the field.  This flag must be set at create time. Lines do not word wrap by default.

    This command creates a scroll layout.  A scroll layout is useful for when you have a number of controls which cannot all be visible at a time.  This layout will display a horizontal and/or vertical scroll bar when necessary to bring into view the hidden controls. Since the scroll layout provides no real positioning of children you should use another control layout as the immediate child.

    This control supports up to 3 icon images and 4 different display styles.  The icon image displayed is the one that best fits the current size of the control given its current style.

    Args:
        align: (create, edit, query) - The label alignment.  Alignment values are "left", "right", and "center". By default, the label is aligned "center". Currently only available when -st/style is set to "iconAndTextCentered".
        annotation: (create, edit, query) - Annotate the control with an extra string value.
        backgroundColor: (create, edit, query) - The background color of the control. The arguments correspond to the red, green, and blue color components. Each component ranges in value from 0.0 to 1.0. When setting backgroundColor, the background is automatically enabled, unless enableBackground is also specified with a false value.
        command: (create, edit, query) - Command executed when the control is pressed.
        commandRepeatable: (create, edit, query) - Set if the MEL command specified in the command flag should be repeatable or not.  The "g" key, by default, is the shortcut to repeat the last executed command.
        defineTemplate: (create) - Puts the command in a mode where any other flags and arguments are parsed and added to the command template specified in the argument. They will be used as default arguments in any subsequent invocations of the command when templateName is set as the current template.
        disabledImage: (create, edit, query) - Image used when the button is disabled. Image size must be the same as the image specified with the i/image flag. This is a Windows only flag.
        docTag: (create, edit, query) - Add a documentation flag to the control.  The documentation flag has a directory structure. (e.g., -dt render/multiLister/createNode/material)
        doubleClickCommand: (create, edit, query) - Command executed when the control is double clicked.
        dragCallback: (create, edit) - Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:  global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods)  The proc returns a string array that is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type.  Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers CTRL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTRL, 3 == CTRL + SHIFT.  In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form:  def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ):  The values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above.  The other way to specify the callback in Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys "dragControl", "x", "y", "modifiers".  The "dragControl" value is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be "print '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'")
        dropCallback: (create, edit) - Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:  global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int $y, int $type)  The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback. $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link.  In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form:  def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ):  The values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above.  The other way to specify the callback in Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys "dragControl", "dropControl", "messages", "x", "y", "type".  The "dragControl" value is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be "print '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'")
        enable: (create, edit, query) - The enable state of the control.  By default, this flag is set to true and the control is enabled.  Specify false and the control will appear dimmed or greyed-out indicating it is disabled.
        enableBackground: (create, edit, query) - Enables the background color of the control.
        enableCommandRepeat: (create, edit, query) - This flag only affects menu items to which a command can be attached.  Specify true and the command may be repeated by executing the command repeatLast.  This flag is true by default for all items except for option box items.
        enableKeyboardFocus: (create, edit, query) - If enabled, the user can navigate to the control with the tab key and select values with the keyboard or mouse. This flag would typically be used to turn off focus support from controls that get it by default, like Edit and List controls. If disabled, text in text fields can still be selected with the mouse but cannot be copied (except on Linux when "Middle Click Paste" is enabled).
        exists: (create) - Returns whether the specified object exists or not. Other flags are ignored.
        flat: (create, edit, query) - Sets whether the control will be a flat button (0 false, 1 true).
        flexibleWidthType: (create, edit, query) - This flag is used to have the shelf button have a wider or thinner width. The valid values are: Standard = 1, Custom = 2, Automatic = 3. The Standard type will resize, keeping the aspect ratio, to 32x32 pixels. The Automatic type will adjust the button width to make sure wide images are used properly. The Custom type will allow the user to choose the desired width for the icon. Default value is 3.
        flexibleWidthValue: (create, edit, query) - This flag is only useful when the Custom flexibleWidthType is chosen. The value is a width in pixels.
        flipX: (create, edit, query) - Is the image flipped horizontally?
        flipY: (create, edit, query) - Is the image flipped vertically?
        font: (create, edit, query) - The font for the text.  Valid values are "boldLabelFont", "smallBoldLabelFont", "tinyBoldLabelFont", "plainLabelFont", "smallPlainLabelFont", "obliqueLabelFont", "smallObliqueLabelFont", "fixedWidthFont" and "smallFixedWidthFont".
        fullPathName: (query) - Return the full path name of the widget, which includes all the parents.
        handleNodeDropCallback: (create, edit) - Specify a script callback which is called when a node is dropped on the control.  The name of the node being dropped will be passed to the function  (python callable) or appended to the end (script) to form the command to be executed.
        height: (create, edit, query) - The height of the control.  The control will attempt to be this size if it is not overruled by parent layout conditions.
        highlightColor: (create, edit, query) - The highlight color of the control. The arguments correspond to the red, green, and blue color components. Each component ranges in value from 0.0 to 1.0.
        highlightImage: (create, edit, query) - Highlight image displayed while the cursor is over the control. Image size must be the same as the image specified with the -i/image flag. This is a Windows only flag.
        image: (create, edit, query) - If you are not providing images with different sizes then you may use this flag for the control's image. If the "iconOnly" style is set, the icon will be scaled to the size of the control.
        image1: (create, edit, query) - First of three possible icons. The icon that best fits the current size of the control will be displayed.
        image2: (create, edit, query) - Second of three possible icons. The icon that best fits the current size of the control will be displayed.
        image3: (create, edit, query) - Third of three possible icons. The icon that best fits the current size of the control will be displayed.
        imageOverlayLabel: (create, edit, query) - A short string, up to 6 characters, representing a label that will be displayed on top of the image.
        isObscured: (query) - Return whether the control can actually be seen by the user. The control will be obscured if its state is invisible, if it is blocked (entirely or partially) by some other control, if it or a parent layout is unmanaged, or if the control's window is invisible or iconified.
        label: (create, edit, query) - The text that appears in the control.
        labelEditingCallback: (create, edit) - Specify a callback which is called after the user double clicks the label of the control to give it a new label. The new label string will be passed to the callback.
        labelOffset: (create, edit, query) - The label offset. Default is 0. Currently only available when -st/style is set to "iconAndTextCentered".
        manage: (create, edit, query) - Manage state of the control.  An unmanaged control is not visible, nor does it take up any screen real estate.  All controls are created managed by default.
        marginHeight: (create, edit, query) - The number of pixels above and below the control content. The default value is 1 pixel.
        marginWidth: (create, edit, query) - The number of pixels on either side of the control content. The default value is 1 pixel.
        menuItem: (create, edit, multiuse) - Creates menu items for this button by passing in arguments for the menu item label and command for each item.  These should be passed as strings: "label" "command" for each use of this flag in the command.
        menuItemPython: (create, edit, multiuse) - This flag is used to specify that a menu item is in Python. The integer value is the index of the menuItem that is modified by this flag. This is 0 based, so it corresponds to the (index+1)th occurrence of the /-mi/-menuItem flag.
        menuItemWithOptionBox: (create, edit, multiuse) - Creates menu items that include an option box.  Arguments passed to the flag are "label" "comand" "option box command";
        noBackground: (create, edit) - Clear/reset the control's background. Passing true means the background should not be drawn at all, false means the background should be drawn.  The state of this flag is inherited by children of this control.
        noDefaultPopup: (create) - Disable the default popup menus.
        numberOfPopupMenus: (query) - Return the number of popup menus attached to this control.
        overlayLabelBackColor: (create, edit, query) - The RGBA color of the shadow behind the label defined by imageOverlayLabel. Default is 50% transparent black: 0 0 0 .5
        overlayLabelColor: (create, edit, query) - The RGB color of the label defined by imageOverlayLabel. Default is a light grey: .8 .8 .8
        parent: (create, query) - The parent layout for this control.
        popupMenuArray: (query) - Return the names of all the popup menus attached to this control.
        preventOverride: (create, edit, query) - If true, this flag prevents overriding the control's attribute via the control's right mouse button menu.
        rotation: (create, edit, query) - The rotation value of the image in radians.
        scaleIcon: (create, edit) - For "textOnly" and "iconOnly" style, this flag has no effect. For other styles, if the flag is specified, the icon will be scaled to the size of the control.
        selectionImage: (create, edit, query) - Image displayed while the control is selected. Image size must be the same as the image specified with the -i/image flag. This is a Windows only flag.
        sourceType: (create, edit, query) - Sets the language type for the command script. Can only be used in conjunction with the c/command or dcc/doubleClickCommand flags. Valid values are "mel" (enabled by default), and "python".
        statusBarMessage: (create, edit) - Extra string to display in the status bar when the mouse is over the control.
        style: (create, edit, query) - The draw style of the control.  Valid styles are "iconOnly", "textOnly", "iconAndTextHorizontal", "iconAndTextVertical", and "iconAndTextCentered". (Note: "iconAndTextCentered" is only available on Windows). If the "iconOnly" style is set, the icon will be scaled to the size of the control.
        useAlpha: (create, edit, query) - Is the image using alpha channel?
        useTemplate: (create) - Forces the command to use a command template other than the current one.
        version: (create, edit, query) - Specify the version that this control feature was introduced. The argument should be given as a string of the version number (e.g. "2013", "2014"). Currently only accepts major version numbers (e.g. 2013 Ext 1, or 2013.5 should be given as "2014").
        visible: (create, edit, query) - The visible state of the control.  A control is created visible by default.  Note that a control's actual appearance is also dependent on the visible state of its parent layout(s).
        visibleChangeCommand: (create, edit, query) - Command that gets executed when visible state of the control changes.
        width: (create, edit, query) - The width of the control.  The control will attempt to be this size if it is not overruled by parent layout conditions.

    This command creates/edits/queries a shelf tab group which is essentially a normal tabLayout with some drop behaviour in the tab bar.  A garbage can icon can appear in the top right corner to dispose of buttons dragged to it from shelves.

    Args:
        annotation: (create, edit, query) - Annotate the control with an extra string value.
        backgroundColor: (create, edit, query) - The background color of the control. The arguments correspond to the red, green, and blue color components. Each component ranges in value from 0.0 to 1.0. When setting backgroundColor, the background is automatically enabled, unless enableBackground is also specified with a false value.
        borderStyle: (create, edit, query) - Specify the style of the border for tab layout. Valid values are: "none", "top", "notop" and "full". By default, it will use "full" to draw a simple frame around the body area of the tab layout.  "none"  - Do not draw borders around the body area of the tab layout "top"   - Only draw a simple line right below the tabs "notop" - Draw a simple frame on the left/right/bottom (no top) of the tab layout "full"  - Draw a simple frame around the body area of the tab layout
        changeCommand: (create, edit) - Command executed when a tab is selected interactively. This command is only invoked when the selected tab changes. Re-selecting the current tab will not invoke this command.
        childArray: (query) - Returns a string array of the names of the layout's immediate children.
        childResizable: (create, query) - Set to true if you want the child of the control layout to be as wide as the scroll area.  You may also indicate a minimum width for the child using the -mcw/minChildWidth flag.
        closeTab: (create, edit) - Close the tab at the given index.
        closeTabCommand: (create, edit) - Specify a script to be executed when one of the tabs are closed by clicking on the header widget (MMB or X button).
        defineTemplate: (create) - Puts the command in a mode where any other flags and arguments are parsed and added to the command template specified in the argument. They will be used as default arguments in any subsequent invocations of the command when templateName is set as the current template.
        docTag: (create, edit, query) - Add a documentation flag to the control.  The documentation flag has a directory structure. (e.g., -dt render/multiLister/createNode/material)
        doubleClickCommand: (create, edit) - Command executed when a tab is double clicked on.  Note that the first click will select the tab and the second click will execute the double click command.  Double clicking the current tab will re-invoke the double click command.
        dragCallback: (create, edit) - Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:  global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods)  The proc returns a string array that is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type.  Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers CTRL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTRL, 3 == CTRL + SHIFT.  In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form:  def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ):  The values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above.  The other way to specify the callback in Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys "dragControl", "x", "y", "modifiers".  The "dragControl" value is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be "print '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'")
        dropCallback: (create, edit) - Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:  global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int $y, int $type)  The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback. $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link.  In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form:  def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ):  The values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above.  The other way to specify the callback in Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys "dragControl", "dropControl", "messages", "x", "y", "type".  The "dragControl" value is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be "print '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'")
        enable: (create, edit, query) - The enable state of the control.  By default, this flag is set to true and the control is enabled.  Specify false and the control will appear dimmed or greyed-out indicating it is disabled.
        enableBackground: (create, edit, query) - Enables the background color of the control.
        enableKeyboardFocus: (create, edit, query) - If enabled, the user can navigate to the control with the tab key and select values with the keyboard or mouse. This flag would typically be used to turn off focus support from controls that get it by default, like Edit and List controls. If disabled, text in text fields can still be selected with the mouse but cannot be copied (except on Linux when "Middle Click Paste" is enabled).
        exists: (create) - Returns whether the specified object exists or not. Other flags are ignored.
        fullPathName: (query) - Return the full path name of the widget, which includes all the parents.
        height: (create, edit, query) - The height of the control.  The control will attempt to be this size if it is not overruled by parent layout conditions.
        highlightColor: (create, edit, query) - The highlight color of the control. The arguments correspond to the red, green, and blue color components. Each component ranges in value from 0.0 to 1.0.
        horizontalScrollBarThickness: (create, edit) - Thickness of the horizontal scroll bar.  Specify an integer value greater than or equal to zero. This flag has no effect on Windows systems.
        image: (create, edit, query) - Image appearing in top right corner of tab layout.
        imageVisible: (create, edit, query) - Visibility of tab image.
        innerMarginHeight: (create, query) - Margin height for all tab children.
        innerMarginWidth: (create, query) - Margin width for all tab children.
        isObscured: (query) - Return whether the control can actually be seen by the user. The control will be obscured if its state is invisible, if it is blocked (entirely or partially) by some other control, if it or a parent layout is unmanaged, or if the control's window is invisible or iconified.
        manage: (create, edit, query) - Manage state of the control.  An unmanaged control is not visible, nor does it take up any screen real estate.  All controls are created managed by default.
        minChildWidth: (create, query) - Specify a positive non-zero integer value indicating the minimum width the tab layout's children.  This flag only has meaning when the -cr/childResizable flag is set to true.
        moveTab: (create, edit) - Move the tab from the current index to a new index.
        newTabCommand: (create, edit) - Command executed when the 'New Tab' button (on the tab bar) is clicked.  Note: in order to show the new tab button use the -snt/showNewTab flag.  Using this command will override any internal Maya logic for adding a new tab (only this command will be executed).
        noBackground: (create, edit) - Clear/reset the control's background. Passing true means the background should not be drawn at all, false means the background should be drawn.  The state of this flag is inherited by children of this control.
        numberOfChildren: (query) - Returns in an int the number of immediate children of the layout.
        numberOfPopupMenus: (query) - Return the number of popup menus attached to this control.
        parent: (create, query) - The parent layout for this control.
        popupMenuArray: (query) - Return the names of all the popup menus attached to this control.
        postMenuCommand: (create, edit) - Specify a script to be executed when the popup menu is about to be shown.
        preSelectCommand: (create, edit) - Command executed when a tab is selected but before it's contents become visible.  Re-selecting the current tab will not invoke this command.  Note that this command is not executed by using either of the -st/selectTab or -sti/selectTabIndex flags.
        preventOverride: (create, edit, query) - If true, this flag prevents overriding the control's attribute via the control's right mouse button menu.
        scrollable: (create, query) - Puts all children of this layout within a scroll area.
        scrollableTabs: (create, edit, query) - If true, the active tab in the layout can be scrolled through with the mouse wheel. Default is true.
        selectCommand: (create, edit, query) - Command executed when a tab is selected interactively  This command will be invoked whenever a tab is selected, ie. re-selecting the current tab will invoke this command.  Note that this command is not executed by using either of the -st/selectTab or -sti/selectTabIndex flags.
        selectTab: (create, edit, query) - The name, in short form, of the selected tab.  An empty string is returned on query if there are no child tabs.
        selectTabIndex: (create, edit, query) - Identical to the -st/selectTab flag except this flag takes a 1-based index to identify the selected tab.  A value of 0 is returned on query if there are no child tabs.
        showNewTab: (create, edit, query) - Set to true if you want to have a 'New Tab' button shown at the end of the tab bar.  Note: use the -ntc/newTabCommand flag to set the command executed when this button is clicked.
        statusBarMessage: (create, edit) - Extra string to display in the status bar when the mouse is over the control.
        tabIcon: (create, edit, multiuse, query) - Set an icon for a tab.  The first argument is the name of a control that must be a child of the tab layout.  The second argument is the icon file name.
        tabIconIndex: (create, edit, multiuse, query) - Identical to the -ti/tabIcon flag except this flag takes a 1-based index to identify the tab you want to set the icon for. If this flag is queried the tab icons for all the children are returned.
        tabLabel: (create, edit, multiuse, query) - Set a tab label.  The first argument is the name of a control that must be a child of the tab layout.  The second argument is the label for the tab associated with that child. If this flag is queried then the tab labels for all the children are returned.
        tabLabelIndex: (create, edit, multiuse, query) - Identical to the -tl/tabLabel flag except this flag takes a 1-based index to identify the tab you want to set the label for. If this flag is queried the tab labels for all the children are returned.
        tabPosition: (create, edit, query) - Changes the tab position. The possible values are: "north", "east" and "west".
        tabTooltip: (create, edit, multiuse, query) - Set a tab tooltip.  The first argument is the name of a control that must be a child of the tab layout.  The second argument is the tooltip for the tab associated with that child. If this flag is queried then the tab tooltips for all the children are returned.
        tabTooltipIndex: (create, edit, multiuse, query) - Identical to the -tt/tabTooltip flag except this flag takes a 1-based index to identify the tab you want to set the tooltip for. If this flag is queried the tab tooltips for all the children are returned.
        tabsClosable: (create, query) - Set to true if you want to have a close button icon on all created tabs.
        tabsVisible: (create, edit, query) - Visibility of the tab labels.
        useTemplate: (create) - Forces the command to use a command template other than the current one.
        verticalScrollBarThickness: (create, edit) - Thickness of the vertical scroll bar.  Specify an integer value greater than or equal to zero. This flag has no effect on Windows systems.
        visible: (create, edit, query) - The visible state of the control.  A control is created visible by default.  Note that a control's actual appearance is also dependent on the visible state of its parent layout(s).
        visibleChangeCommand: (create, edit, query) - Command that gets executed when visible state of the control changes.
        width: (create, edit, query) - The width of the control.  The control will attempt to be this size if it is not overruled by parent layout conditions.

Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTRL, 3 == CTRL + SHIFT.  In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form:  def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ):  The values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above.  The other way to specify the callback in Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys "dragControl", "x", "y", "modifiers".  The "dragControl" value is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be "print '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'")
        dropCallback: (create) - Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:  global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int $y, int $type)  The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback. $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link.  In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form:  def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ):  The values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above.  The other way to specify the callback in Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys "dragControl", "dropControl", "messages", "x", "y", "type".  The "dragControl" value is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be "print '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'")
        enable: (create) - The enable state of the control.  By default, this flag is set to true and the control is enabled.  Specify false and the control will appear dimmed or greyed-out indicating it is disabled.
        enableBackground: (create) - Enables the background color of the control.
        enableKeyboardFocus: (create) - If enabled, the user can navigate to the control with the tab key and select values with the keyboard or mouse. This flag would typically be used to turn off focus support from controls that get it by default, like Edit and List controls. If disabled, text in text fields can still be selected with the mouse but cannot be copied (except on Linux when "Middle Click Paste" is enabled).
        exists: (create) - Returns whether the specified object exists or not. Other flags are ignored.
        fullPathName: (create) - Return the full path name of the widget, which includes all the parents.
        height: (create) - The height of the control.  The control will attempt to be this size if it is not overruled by parent layout conditions.
        highlightColor: (create) - The highlight color of the control. The arguments correspond to the red, green, and blue color components. Each component ranges in value from 0.0 to 1.0.
        isObscured: (create) - Return whether the control can actually be seen by the user. The control will be obscured if its state is invisible, if it is blocked (entirely or partially) by some other control, if it or a parent layout is unmanaged, or if the control's window is invisible or iconified.
        manage: (create) - Manage state of the control.  An unmanaged control is not visible, nor does it take up any screen real estate.  All controls are created managed by default.
        noBackground: (create) - Clear/reset the control's background. Passing true means the background should not be drawn at all, false means the background should be drawn.  The state of this flag is inherited by children of this control.
        numberOfPopupMenus: (create) - Return the number of popup menus attached to this control.
        parent: (create) - The parent layout for this control.
        popupMenuArray: (create) - Return the names of all the popup menus attached to this control.
        preventOverride: (create) - If true, this flag prevents overriding the control's attribute via the control's right mouse button menu.
        statusBarMessage: (create) - Extra string to display in the status bar when the mouse is over the control.
        useTemplate: (create) - Forces the command to use a command template other than the current one.
        visible: (create) - The visible state of the control.  A control is created visible by default.  Note that a control's actual appearance is also dependent on the visible state of its parent layout(s).
        visibleChangeCommand: (create) - Command that gets executed when visible state of the control changes.
        width: (create) - The width of the control.  The control will attempt to be this size if it is not overruled by parent layout conditions.

    This command creates a new spread sheet editor in the current layout.

    Args:
        allAttr: (query) - Returns a list of all the attribute names currently being displayed.  This flag is ignored when not being queried.
        attrRegExp: (create, edit, query) - Filter the current displayed attribute names. This expression matches the case-insensitive substring of attribute names.
        control: (query) - Query only. Returns the top level control for this editor. Usually used for getting a parent to attach popup menus. Caution: It is possible for an editor to exist without a control. The query will return "NONE" if no control is present.
        defineTemplate: (create) - Puts the command in a mode where any other flags and arguments are parsed and added to the command template specified in the argument. They will be used as default arguments in any subsequent invocations of the command when templateName is set as the current template.
        docTag: (create, edit, query) - Attaches a tag to the editor.
        execute: (edit) - Immediately executes the command string once for every selected cell in the spreadSheet.  Before the command is executed, "#A" is substituted with the name of the cell's attribute, "#N" is substituted with the name of the cell's node, and "#P" is substituted with the full path name of the node.
        exists: (create) - Returns whether the specified object exists or not. Other flags are ignored.
        filter: (create, edit, query) - Specifies the name of an itemFilter object to be used with this editor. This filters the information coming onto the main list of the editor.
        fixedAttrList: (create, edit, query) - Forces the editor to only display attributes with the specified names.
        forceMainConnection: (create, edit, query) - Specifies the name of a selectionConnection object that the editor will use as its source of content. The editor will only display items contained in the selectionConnection object. This is a variant of the -mainListConnection flag in that it will force a change even when the connection is locked. This flag is used to reduce the overhead when using the -unlockMainConnection , -mainListConnection, -lockMainConnection flags in immediate succession.
        highlightConnection: (create, edit, query) - Specifies the name of a selectionConnection object that the editor will synchronize with its highlight list. Not all editors have a highlight list. For those that do, it is a secondary selection list.
        keyableOnly: (create, edit, query) - Limits the displayed attributes to be those that are keyable. True by default
        lockMainConnection: (create, edit) - Locks the current list of objects within the mainConnection, so that only those objects are displayed within the editor. Further changes to the original mainConnection are ignored.
        longNames: (create, edit, query) - Controls whether the attributes are displayed using their long names or their short names.
        mainListConnection: (create, edit, query) - Specifies the name of a selectionConnection object that the editor will use as its source of content. The editor will only display items contained in the selectionConnection object.
        niceNames: (create, edit, query) - Controls whether the attribute names will be displayed in a more user-friendly, readable way.  When this is on, the longNames flag is ignored.  When this is off, attribute names will be displayed either long or short, according to the longNames flag. Default is on. Queried, returns a boolean.
        panel: (create, query) - Specifies the panel for this editor. By default if an editor is created in the create callback of a scripted panel it will belong to that panel. If an editor does not belong to a panel it will be deleted when the window that it is in is deleted.
        parent: (create, edit, query) - Specifies the parent layout for this editor. This flag will only have an effect if the editor is currently un-parented.
        precision: (create, edit, query) - Specifies the maximum number of digits displayed to the right of the decimal place.  Can be 0 to 20.
        selectedAttr: (query) - Returns a list of all the attribute names that are selected.  This flag is ignored when not being queried.
        selectionConnection: (create, edit, query) - Specifies the name of a selectionConnection object that the editor will synchronize with its own selection list. As the user selects things in this editor, they will be selected in the selectionConnection object. If the object undergoes changes, the editor updates to show the changes.
        showShapes: (create, edit, query) - If true, when transforms are selected their shapes will be displayed instead.
        stateString: (query) - Query only flag. Returns the MEL command that will create an editor to match the current editor state. The returned command string uses the string variable $editorName in place of a specific name.
        unParent: (create, edit) - Specifies that the editor should be removed from its layout. This cannot be used in query mode.
        unlockMainConnection: (create, edit) - Unlocks the mainConnection, effectively restoring the original mainConnection (if it is still available), and dynamic updates.
        updateMainConnection: (create, edit) - Causes a locked mainConnection to be updated from the orginal mainConnection, but preserves the lock state.

    This command creates a symbol button.  A symbol button behaves like a regular button, the only difference is a symbol button displays an image rather that a text label.  A command may be attached to the button which will be executed when the button is pressed.

    Args:
        annotation: (create, edit, query) - Annotate the control with an extra string value.
        backgroundColor: (create, edit, query) - The background color of the control. The arguments correspond to the red, green, and blue color components. Each component ranges in value from 0.0 to 1.0. When setting backgroundColor, the background is automatically enabled, unless enableBackground is also specified with a false value.
        command: (create, edit, query) - Command executed when the symbol button is pressed.
        defineTemplate: (create) - Puts the command in a mode where any other flags and arguments are parsed and added to the command template specified in the argument. They will be used as default arguments in any subsequent invocations of the command when templateName is set as the current template.
        docTag: (create, edit, query) - Add a documentation flag to the control.  The documentation flag has a directory structure. (e.g., -dt render/multiLister/createNode/material)
        dragCallback: (create, edit) - Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:  global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods)  The proc returns a string array that is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type.  Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers CTRL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTRL, 3 == CTRL + SHIFT.  In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form:  def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ):  The values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above.  The other way to specify the callback in Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys "dragControl", "x", "y", "modifiers".  The "dragControl" value is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be "print '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'")
        dropCallback: (create, edit) - Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:  global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int $y, int $type)  The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback. $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link.  In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form:  def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ):  The values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above.  The other way to specify the callback in Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys "dragControl", "dropControl", "messages", "x", "y", "type".  The "dragControl" value is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be "print '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'")
        enable: (create, edit, query) - The enable state of the control.  By default, this flag is set to true and the control is enabled.  Specify false and the control will appear dimmed or greyed-out indicating it is disabled.
        enableBackground: (create, edit, query) - Enables the background color of the control.
        enableKeyboardFocus: (create, edit, query) - If enabled, the user can navigate to the control with the tab key and select values with the keyboard or mouse. This flag would typically be used to turn off focus support from controls that get it by default, like Edit and List controls. If disabled, text in text fields can still be selected with the mouse but cannot be copied (except on Linux when "Middle Click Paste" is enabled).
        exists: (create) - Returns whether the specified object exists or not. Other flags are ignored.
        fullPathName: (query) - Return the full path name of the widget, which includes all the parents.
        height: (create, edit, query) - The height of the control.  The control will attempt to be this size if it is not overruled by parent layout conditions.
        highlightColor: (create, edit, query) - The highlight color of the control. The arguments correspond to the red, green, and blue color components. Each component ranges in value from 0.0 to 1.0.
        image: (create, edit, query) - Image for the button.
        isObscured: (query) - Return whether the control can actually be seen by the user. The control will be obscured if its state is invisible, if it is blocked (entirely or partially) by some other control, if it or a parent layout is unmanaged, or if the control's window is invisible or iconified.
        manage: (create, edit, query) - Manage state of the control.  An unmanaged control is not visible, nor does it take up any screen real estate.  All controls are created managed by default.
        noBackground: (create, edit) - Clear/reset the control's background. Passing true means the background should not be drawn at all, false means the background should be drawn.  The state of this flag is inherited by children of this control.
        numberOfPopupMenus: (query) - Return the number of popup menus attached to this control.
        parent: (create, query) - The parent layout for this control.
        popupMenuArray: (query) - Return the names of all the popup menus attached to this control.
        preventOverride: (create, edit, query) - If true, this flag prevents overriding the control's attribute via the control's right mouse button menu.
        statusBarMessage: (create, edit) - Extra string to display in the status bar when the mouse is over the control.
        useTemplate: (create) - Forces the command to use a command template other than the current one.
        visible: (create, edit, query) - The visible state of the control.  A control is created visible by default.  Note that a control's actual appearance is also dependent on the visible state of its parent layout(s).
        visibleChangeCommand: (create, edit, query) - Command that gets executed when visible state of the control changes.

        borderStyle: (create, edit, query) - Specify the style of the border for tab layout. Valid values are: "none", "top", "notop" and "full". By default, it will use "full" to draw a simple frame around the body area of the tab layout.  "none"  - Do not draw borders around the body area of the tab layout "top"   - Only draw a simple line right below the tabs "notop" - Draw a simple frame on the left/right/bottom (no top) of the tab layout "full"  - Draw a simple frame around the body area of the tab layout
        changeCommand: (create, edit) - Command executed when a tab is selected interactively. This command is only invoked when the selected tab changes. Re-selecting the current tab will not invoke this command.
        childArray: (query) - Returns a string array of the names of the layout's immediate children.
        childResizable: (create, query) - Set to true if you want the child of the control layout to be as wide as the scroll area.  You may also indicate a minimum width for the child using the -mcw/minChildWidth flag.
        closeTab: (create, edit) - Close the tab at the given index.
        closeTabCommand: (create, edit) - Specify a script to be executed when one of the tabs are closed by clicking on the header widget (MMB or X button).

        minChildWidth: (create, query) - Specify a positive non-zero integer value indicating the minimum width the tab layout's children.  This flag only has meaning when the -cr/childResizable flag is set to true.
        moveTab: (create, edit) - Move the tab from the current index to a new index.
        newTabCommand: (create, edit) - Command executed when the 'New Tab' button (on the tab bar) is clicked.  Note: in order to show the new tab button use the -snt/showNewTab flag.  Using this command will override any internal Maya logic for adding a new tab (only this command will be executed).
        noBackground: (create, edit) - Clear/reset the control's background. Passing true means the background should not be drawn at all, false means the background should be drawn.  The state of this flag is inherited by children of this control.
        numberOfChildren: (query) - Returns in an int the number of immediate children of the layout.
        numberOfPopupMenus: (query) - Return the number of popup menus attached to this control.

        preSelectCommand: (create, edit) - Command executed when a tab is selected but before it's contents become visible.  Re-selecting the current tab will not invoke this command.  Note that this command is not executed by using either of the -st/selectTab or -sti/selectTabIndex flags.
        preventOverride: (create, edit, query) - If true, this flag prevents overriding the control's attribute via the control's right mouse button menu.
        scrollable: (create, query) - Puts all children of this layout within a scroll area.
        scrollableTabs: (create, edit, query) - If true, the active tab in the layout can be scrolled through with the mouse wheel. Default is true.
        selectCommand: (create, edit, query) - Command executed when a tab is selected interactively  This command will be invoked whenever a tab is selected, ie. re-selecting the current tab will invoke this command.  Note that this command is not executed by using either of the -st/selectTab or -sti/selectTabIndex flags.
        selectTab: (create, edit, query) - The name, in short form, of the selected tab.  An empty string is returned on query if there are no child tabs.
        selectTabIndex: (create, edit, query) - Identical to the -st/selectTab flag except this flag takes a 1-based index to identify the selected tab.  A value of 0 is returned on query if there are no child tabs.
        showNewTab: (create, edit, query) - Set to true if you want to have a 'New Tab' button shown at the end of the tab bar.  Note: use the -ntc/newTabCommand flag to set the command executed when this button is clicked.

        tabIcon: (create, edit, multiuse, query) - Set an icon for a tab.  The first argument is the name of a control that must be a child of the tab layout.  The second argument is the icon file name.
        tabIconIndex: (create, edit, multiuse, query) - Identical to the -ti/tabIcon flag except this flag takes a 1-based index to identify the tab you want to set the icon for. If this flag is queried the tab icons for all the children are returned.
        tabLabel: (create, edit, multiuse, query) - Set a tab label.  The first argument is the name of a control that must be a child of the tab layout.  The second argument is the label for the tab associated with that child. If this flag is queried then the tab labels for all the children are returned.
        tabLabelIndex: (create, edit, multiuse, query) - Identical to the -tl/tabLabel flag except this flag takes a 1-based index to identify the tab you want to set the label for. If this flag is queried the tab labels for all the children are returned.
        tabPosition: (create, edit, query) - Changes the tab position. The possible values are: "north", "east" and "west".
        tabTooltip: (create, edit, multiuse, query) - Set a tab tooltip.  The first argument is the name of a control that must be a child of the tab layout.

    Create a simple text label control.

    Args:
        align: (create, edit, query) - The label alignment.  Alignment values are "left", "right", and "center".  Note that the alignment will only be noticable if the control is wider than the label length. By default, the label is aligned "center".
        annotation: (create, edit, query) - Annotate the control with an extra string value.
        backgroundColor: (create, edit, query) - The background color of the control. The arguments correspond to the red, green, and blue color components. Each component ranges in value from 0.0 to 1.0. When setting backgroundColor, the background is automatically enabled, unless enableBackground is also specified with a false value.
        defineTemplate: (create) - Puts the command in a mode where any other flags and arguments are parsed and added to the command template specified in the argument. They will be used as default arguments in any subsequent invocations of the command when templateName is set as the current template.
        docTag: (create, edit, query) - Add a documentation flag to the control.  The documentation flag has a directory structure. (e.g., -dt render/multiLister/createNode/material)
        dragCallback: (create, edit) - Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:  global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods)  The proc returns a string array that is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type.  Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers CTRL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTRL, 3 == CTRL + SHIFT.  In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form:  def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ):  The values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above.  The other way to specify the callback in Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys "dragControl", "x", "y", "modifiers".  The "dragControl" value is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be "print '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'")
        dropCallback: (create, edit) - Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:  global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int $y, int $type)  The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback. $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link.  In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form:  def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ):  The values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above.  The other way to specify the callback in Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys "dragControl", "dropControl", "messages", "x", "y", "type".  The "dragControl" value is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be "print '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'")
        dropRectCallback: (edit) - Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is hovering above the drop site.  It returns the shape of the rectangle to be drawn to highlight the entry, if the control can receive the dropped data. The MEL version of the callback is of the form:  global proc int[] callbackName(string $dropControl, int $x, int $y)  The return value is an array of size 4, with the parameters, in order, being the left and top coordinates of the rectangle to be drawn, followed by the width and height. This functionality is currently only implemented in MEL.
        enable: (create, edit, query) - The enable state of the control.  By default, this flag is set to true and the control is enabled.  Specify false and the control will appear dimmed or greyed-out indicating it is disabled.
        enableBackground: (create, edit, query) - Enables the background color of the control.
        enableKeyboardFocus: (create, edit, query) - If enabled, the user can navigate to the control with the tab key and select values with the keyboard or mouse. This flag would typically be used to turn off focus support from controls that get it by default, like Edit and List controls. If disabled, text in text fields can still be selected with the mouse but cannot be copied (except on Linux when "Middle Click Paste" is enabled).
        exists: (create) - Returns whether the specified object exists or not. Other flags are ignored.
        font: (create, edit, query) - The font for the text.  Valid values are "boldLabelFont", "smallBoldLabelFont", "tinyBoldLabelFont", "plainLabelFont", "smallPlainLabelFont", "obliqueLabelFont", "smallObliqueLabelFont", "fixedWidthFont" and "smallFixedWidthFont".
        fullPathName: (query) - Return the full path name of the widget, which includes all the parents.
        height: (create, edit, query) - The height of the control.  The control will attempt to be this size if it is not overruled by parent layout conditions.
        highlightColor: (create, edit, query) - The highlight color of the control. The arguments correspond to the red, green, and blue color components. Each component ranges in value from 0.0 to 1.0.
        hyperlink: (create, edit, query) - Sets the label text to be a hyperlink if the argument is true.  The label text must be a proper HTML link. In MEL, double quotes in the link will most likely have to be protected from the MEL interpreter by preceding them with a backslash.  Clicking on the link will open it in an external Web browser.
        isObscured: (query) - Return whether the control can actually be seen by the user. The control will be obscured if its state is invisible, if it is blocked (entirely or partially) by some other control, if it or a parent layout is unmanaged, or if the control's window is invisible or iconified.
        label: (create, edit, query) - The label text.  The default label is the name of the control.
        manage: (create, edit, query) - Manage state of the control.  An unmanaged control is not visible, nor does it take up any screen real estate.  All controls are created managed by default.
        noBackground: (create, edit) - Clear/reset the control's background. Passing true means the background should not be drawn at all, false means the background should be drawn.  The state of this flag is inherited by children of this control.
        numberOfPopupMenus: (query) - Return the number of popup menus attached to this control.
        parent: (create, query) - The parent layout for this control.
        popupMenuArray: (query) - Return the names of all the popup menus attached to this control.
        preventOverride: (create, edit, query) - If true, this flag prevents overriding the control's attribute via the control's right mouse button menu.
        recomputeSize: (create, edit, query) - If true then the control will recompute it's size to just fit the size of the label.  If false then the control size will remain fixed as you change the size of the label.  The default value of this flag is true.
        statusBarMessage: (create, edit) - Extra string to display in the status bar when the mouse is over the control.
        useTemplate: (create) - Forces the command to use a command template other than the current one.
        visible: (create, edit, query) - The visible state of the control.  A control is created visible by default.  Note that a control's actual appearance is also dependent on the visible state of its parent layout(s).
        visibleChangeCommand: (create, edit, query) - Command that gets executed when visible state of the control changes.
        width: (create, edit, query) - The width of the control.  The control will attempt to be this size if it is not overruled by parent layout conditions.
        wordWrap: (create, query) - If true then label text is wrapped where necessary at word-breaks. If false, it is not wrapped at all. The default value of this flag is false.

They will be used as default arguments in any subsequent invocations of the command when templateName is set as the current template.
        docTag: (create, edit, query) - Add a documentation flag to the control.  The documentation flag has a directory structure. (e.g., -dt render/multiLister/createNode/material)
        dragCallback: (create, edit) - Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:  global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods)  The proc returns a string array that is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type.  Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers CTRL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTRL, 3 == CTRL + SHIFT.  In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form:  def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ):  The values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above.  The other way to specify the callback in Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys "dragControl", "x", "y", "modifiers".  The "dragControl" value is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be "print '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'")
        dropCallback: (create, edit) - Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:  global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int $y, int $type)  The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback. $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link.  In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form:  def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ):  The values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above.  The other way to specify the callback in Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys "dragControl", "dropControl", "messages", "x", "y", "type".  The "dragControl" value is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be "print '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'")
        editable: (create, edit, query) - The edit state of the field.  By default, this flag is set to true and the field value may be changed by typing into it. If false then the field is 'read only' and can not be typed into. The text in the field can always be changed with the -tx/text flag regardless of the state of the -ed/editable flag.
        enable: (create, edit, query) - The enable state of the control.  By default, this flag is set to true and the control is enabled.  Specify false and the control will appear dimmed or greyed-out indicating it is disabled.
        enableBackground: (create, edit, query) - Enables the background color of the control.
        enableButton: (create, edit, query) - Enable state of the button.  By default, this flag is set to true and the button is enabled.  Specify true, and the button will appear dimmed or greyed-out indicating it is disabled.
        enableKeyboardFocus: (create, edit, query) - If enabled, the user can navigate to the control with the tab key and select values with the keyboard or mouse. This flag would typically be used to turn off focus support from controls that get it by default, like Edit and List controls. If disabled, text in text fields can still be selected with the mouse but cannot be copied (except on Linux when "Middle Click Paste" is enabled).
        exists: (create) - Returns whether the specified object exists or not. Other flags are ignored.
        fileName: (create, edit, query) - Text in the field as a filename. This does conversions between internal and external (UI) file representation.
        forceChangeCommand: (create, edit) - If used together with -text or -inserText flag, change command will be executed after text modification.
        fullPathName: (query) - Return the full path name of the widget, which includes all the parents.
        height: (create, edit, query) - The height of the control.  The control will attempt to be this size if it is not overruled by parent layout conditions.
        highlightColor: (create, edit, query) - The highlight color of the control. The arguments correspond to the red, green, and blue color components. Each component ranges in value from 0.0 to 1.0.
        insertText: (create, edit) - Insert text into the field at the current insertion position (specified by the -ip/insertionPosition flag).
        insertionPosition: (create, edit, query) - The insertion position for inserted text.  This is a 1 based value where position 1 specifies the beginning of the field.  Position 0 may be used to specify the end of the field.
        isObscured: (query) - Return whether the control can actually be seen by the user. The control will be obscured if its state is invisible, if it is blocked (entirely or partially) by some other control, if it or a parent layout is unmanaged, or if the control's window is invisible or iconified.
        label: (create, edit, query) - Label text for the group.
        manage: (create, edit, query) - Manage state of the control.  An unmanaged control is not visible, nor does it take up any screen real estate.  All controls are created managed by default.
        noBackground: (create, edit) - Clear/reset the control's background. Passing true means the background should not be drawn at all, false means the background should be drawn.  The state of this flag is inherited by children of this control.
        numberOfPopupMenus: (query) - Return the number of popup menus attached to this control.
        parent: (create, query) - The parent layout for this control.
        placeholderText: (create, edit, query) - Setting this property makes the line edit display a grayed-out placeholder text as long as the text field is empty and the widget doesn't have focus. By default, this property contains an empty string.
        popupMenuArray: (query) - Return the names of all the popup menus attached to this control.
        preventOverride: (create, edit, query) - If true, this flag prevents overriding the control's attribute via the control's right mouse button menu.
        rowAttach: (create, edit, multiuse) - Arguments are : column, attachment type, offset. Possible attachments are: top | bottom | both. Specifies attachment types and offsets for the entire row.
        statusBarMessage: (create, edit) - Extra string to display in the status bar when the mouse is over the control.
        text: (create, edit, query) - Text in the field.
        textChangedCommand: (create, edit) - Command executed immediately when the field text changes.
        useTemplate: (create) - Forces the command to use a command template other than the current one.
        visible: (create, edit, query) - The visible state of the control.  A control is created visible by default.  Note that a control's actual appearance is also dependent on the visible state of its parent layout(s).
        visibleChangeCommand: (create, edit, query) - Command that gets executed when visible state of the control changes.
        width: (create, edit, query) - The width of the control.  The control will attempt to be this size if it is not overruled by parent layout conditions.

        columnWidth2: (create, edit) - Sets the column widths of both columns. Ignored if there are not exactly two columns.
        columnWidth3: (create, edit) - Sets the column widths for all 3 columns. Ignored if there are not exactly 3 columns.
        columnWidth4: (create, edit) - Sets the column widths for all 4 columns. Ignored if there are not exactly 4 columns.
        columnWidth5: (create, edit) - Sets the column widths for all 5 columns. Ignored if there are not exactly 5 columns.
        columnWidth6: (create, edit) - Sets the column widths for all 6 columns. Ignored if there are not exactly 6 columns.
        defineTemplate: (create) - Puts the command in a mode where any other flags and arguments are parsed and added to the command template specified in the argument. They will be used as default arguments in any subsequent invocations of the command when templateName is set as the current template.
        docTag: (create, edit, query) - Add a documentation flag to the control.  The documentation flag has a directory structure. (e.g., -dt render/multiLister/createNode/material)
        dragCallback: (create, edit) - Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:  global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods)  The proc returns a string array that is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type.  Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers CTRL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTRL, 3 == CTRL + SHIFT.  In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form:  def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ):  The values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above.  The other way to specify the callback in Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys "dragControl", "x", "y", "modifiers".  The "dragControl" value is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be "print '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'")
        dropCallback: (create, edit) - Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:  global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int $y, int $type)  The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback. $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link.  In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form:  def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ):  The values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above.  The other way to specify the callback in Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys "dragControl", "dropControl", "messages", "x", "y", "type".  The "dragControl" value is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be "print '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'")
        editable: (create, edit, query) - The edit state of the field.  By default, this flag is set to true and the field value may be changed by typing into it. If false then the field is 'read only' and can not be typed into. The text in the field can always be changed with the -tx/text flag regardless of the state of the -ed/editable flag.
        enable: (create, edit, query) - The enable state of the control.  By default, this flag is set to true and the control is enabled.  Specify false and the control will appear dimmed or greyed-out indicating it is disabled.
        enableBackground: (create, edit, query) - Enables the background color of the control.
        enableKeyboardFocus: (create, edit, query) - If enabled, the user can navigate to the control with the tab key and select values with the keyboard or mouse. This flag would typically be used to turn off focus support from controls that get it by default, like Edit and List controls. If disabled, text in text fields can still be selected with the mouse but cannot be copied (except on Linux when "Middle Click Paste" is enabled).
        exists: (create) - Returns whether the specified object exists or not. Other flags are ignored.
        fileName: (create, edit, query) - Text in the field as a filename. This does conversions between internal and external (UI) file representation.
        forceChangeCommand: (create, edit) - If used together with -text or -inserText flag, change command will be executed after text modification.
        fullPathName: (query) - Return the full path name of the widget, which includes all the parents.
        height: (create, edit, query) - The height of the control.  The control will attempt to be this size if it is not overruled by parent layout conditions.
        highlightColor: (create, edit, query) - The highlight color of the control. The arguments correspond to the red, green, and blue color components. Each component ranges in value from 0.0 to 1.0.
        insertText: (create, edit) - Insert text into the field at the current insertion position (specified by the -ip/insertionPosition flag).
        insertionPosition: (create, edit, query) - The insertion position for inserted text.  This is a 1 based value where position 1 specifies the beginning of the field.  Position 0 may be used to specify the end of the field.
        isObscured: (query) - Return whether the control can actually be seen by the user. The control will be obscured if its state is invisible, if it is blocked (entirely or partially) by some other control, if it or a parent layout is unmanaged, or if the control's window is invisible or iconified.
        label: (create, edit, query) - Label text for the group.
        manage: (create, edit, query) - Manage state of the control.  An unmanaged control is not visible, nor does it take up any screen real estate.  All controls are created managed by default.
        noBackground: (create, edit) - Clear/reset the control's background. Passing true means the background should not be drawn at all, false means the background should be drawn.  The state of this flag is inherited by children of this control.
        numberOfPopupMenus: (query) - Return the number of popup menus attached to this control.
        parent: (create, query) - The parent layout for this control.
        placeholderText: (create, edit, query) - Setting this property makes the line edit display a grayed-out placeholder text as long as the text field is empty and the widget doesn't have focus. By default, this property contains an empty string.
        popupMenuArray: (query) - Return the names of all the popup menus attached to this control.
        preventOverride: (create, edit, query) - If true, this flag prevents overriding the control's attribute via the control's right mouse button menu.
        rowAttach: (create, edit, multiuse) - Arguments are : column, attachment type, offset. Possible attachments are: top | bottom | both. Specifies attachment types and offsets for the entire row.
        statusBarMessage: (create, edit) - Extra string to display in the status bar when the mouse is over the control.
        text: (create, edit, query) - Text in the field.
        textChangedCommand: (create, edit) - Command executed immediately when the field text changes.
        useTemplate: (create) - Forces the command to use a command template other than the current one.
        visible: (create, edit, query) - The visible state of the control.  A control is created visible by default.  Note that a control's actual appearance is also dependent on the visible state of its parent layout(s).
        visibleChangeCommand: (create, edit, query) - Command that gets executed when visible state of the control changes.
        width: (create, edit, query) - The width of the control.  The control will attempt to be this size if it is not overruled by parent layout conditions.

        allowAutomaticSelection: (create, edit, query) - Specify automatic selection mode.  When automaticSelection is on each item that the mouse is over (during dragging once an item has been selected) will be selected.  Thus, if -sc/selectCommand someCommand is set, someCommand will be called for each selected item. If -aas/allowAutomaticSelection is off, then only the item selected when the mouse button is up will be the selected item, so -sc/selectCommand someCommand is only called once if it is set.

The other way to specify the callback in Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys "dragControl", "x", "y", "modifiers".  The "dragControl" value is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be "print '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'")
        dropCallback: (create, edit) - Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:  global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int $y, int $type)  The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback. $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link.  In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form:  def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ):  The values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above.  The other way to specify the callback in Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys "dragControl", "dropControl", "messages", "x", "y", "type".  The "dragControl" value is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be "print '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'")
        enable: (create, edit, query) - The enable state of the control.  By default, this flag is set to true and the control is enabled.  Specify false and the control will appear dimmed or greyed-out indicating it is disabled.
        enableBackground: (create, edit, query) - Enables the background color of the control.
        enableKeyboardFocus: (create, edit, query) - If enabled, the user can navigate to the control with the tab key and select values with the keyboard or mouse. This flag would typically be used to turn off focus support from controls that get it by default, like Edit and List controls. If disabled, text in text fields can still be selected with the mouse but cannot be copied (except on Linux when "Middle Click Paste" is enabled).
        endScrub: (edit) - End sound scubbing for this widget.  This stops sound scrubbing behavior and should be issued before any subsequent "-beginScrub" flags
        exists: (create) - Returns whether the specified object exists or not. Other flags are ignored.
        forceRedraw: (create, edit) - Force a redraw of the time control UI. Similiar to forceRefresh but does not rebuild key information.
        forceRefresh: (create, edit) - Force a refresh of the time control UI.
        foregroundColor: (edit) - This flag is used to specify the rgb color of the vertical lines and numeric text in the timeControl.
        fullPathName: (query) - Return the full path name of the widget, which includes all the parents.
        globalTime: (create, edit, query) - "true" means this widget controls and displays the global, dependency graph time.  "false" means time changes here do NOT affect the dependency graph. Query returns int.
        height: (create, edit, query) - The height of the control.  The control will attempt to be this size if it is not overruled by parent layout conditions.
        highlightColor: (create, edit, query) - The highlight color of the control. The arguments correspond to the red, green, and blue color components. Each component ranges in value from 0.0 to 1.0.
        isObscured: (query) - Return whether the control can actually be seen by the user. The control will be obscured if its state is invisible, if it is blocked (entirely or partially) by some other control, if it or a parent layout is unmanaged, or if the control's window is invisible or iconified.
        mainListConnection: (create, edit, query) - Specifies the name of a selectionConnection object that the time slider will use as its source of content.  The time slider will only display keys for items contained in the selectionConnection object.
        manage: (create, edit, query) - Manage state of the control.  An unmanaged control is not visible, nor does it take up any screen real estate.  All controls are created managed by default.
        noBackground: (create, edit) - Clear/reset the control's background. Passing true means the background should not be drawn at all, false means the background should be drawn.  The state of this flag is inherited by children of this control.
        numberOfPopupMenus: (query) - Return the number of popup menus attached to this control.
        parent: (create, query) - The parent layout for this control.
        popupMenuArray: (query) - Return the names of all the popup menus attached to this control.
        pressCommand: (create, edit) - script to run on mouse-down in this control.
        preventOverride: (create, edit, query) - If true, this flag prevents overriding the control's attribute via the control's right mouse button menu.
        range: (create, query) - Returns string representing the currently highlighted range visible on the time slider.  A range from 10 to 20 would be returned as "10:20".  When there's no range visible on the time slider, the query returns a range spanning the current time: for example, "10:11".  These values are in the current time unit.
        rangeArray: (create, query) - Returns a float array representing the currently highlighted range visible on the time slider.  A range from 10 to 20 would be returned as { 10.0, 20.0 }.  When there's no range visible on the time slider, the query returns values spanning the current time: { 10.0, 11.0 }.  These values are in the current time unit.
        rangeVisible: (create, query) - Returns true if a currently highlighted range is visible on the time slider, false if no.
        releaseCommand: (create, edit) - script to run on mouse-up in this control.
        repeatChunkSize: (edit, query) - How much sound (in the current time unit) is repeated when -repeatOnHold is true.  Default is 1.0.
        repeatOnHold: (edit, query) - Repeat sound during mouse-down events
        resample: (edit) - Resample the sound display to fit the widget
        showKeys: (create, edit, query) - "active" will show tick marks for keyframes on all active objects.  "none" shows no tick marks.  Any other name is taken as the name of a channel box whose selected attributes will display tick marks.  Default "active".  Query returns string.
        showKeysCombined: (create, edit, query) - This flag can be used in conjunction with the showKeys flag to enable a combination of "active" + "channel box" behavior. Specifically, if channel box attributes are selected, tick marks will be shown for those attributes. If no channel box attributes are selected, tick marks will be shown for keyframes on all active objects.
        snap: (create, edit, query) - "true" means this widget is constrained to having values that are integers representing the current time unit.. "false" means the current time indicator is "free floating" and not constrained.
        sound: (edit, query) - Name of audio depend node whose data should display in the sound-display widget. Query returns string.
        statusBarMessage: (create, edit) - Extra string to display in the status bar when the mouse is over the control.
        tickSize: (create, edit, query) - Specifies the width of keyframe ticks drawn in the time slider. The value will be clamped to the range [1, 63].
        tickSpan: (create, edit, query) - Specifies the interval between keyframe ticks in the timeControl. For example, a value of 10, will place ticks at 0, 10, 20, etc.
        useTemplate: (create) - Forces the command to use a command template other than the current one.
        visible: (create, edit, query) - The visible state of the control.  A control is created visible by default.  Note that a control's actual appearance is also dependent on the visible state of its parent layout(s).
        visibleChangeCommand: (create, edit, query) - Command that gets executed when visible state of the control changes.
        waveform: (edit, query) - Determines what part of the sound waveform to display, when -displaySound is "true". Valid values are "top", "bottom", and "both".  Default is "top". Query returns string.
        width: (create, edit, query) - The width of the control.  The control will attempt to be this size if it is not overruled by parent layout conditions.

Dragging the invisible slider to the right with the middle mouse button increases the field value by the amount specified with the

    Args:
        annotation: (create, edit, query) - Annotate the control with an extra string value.
        backgroundColor: (create, edit, query) - The background color of the control. The arguments correspond to the red, green, and blue color components. Each component ranges in value from 0.0 to 1.0. When setting backgroundColor, the background is automatically enabled, unless enableBackground is also specified with a false value.
        changeCommand: (create, edit) - Command executed when the field changes.  This command is not invoked when the value changes via the -v/value flag.
        defineTemplate: (create) - Puts the command in a mode where any other flags and arguments are parsed and added to the command template specified in the argument. They will be used as default arguments in any subsequent invocations of the command when templateName is set as the current template.
        docTag: (create, edit, query) - Add a documentation flag to the control.  The documentation flag has a directory structure. (e.g., -dt render/multiLister/createNode/material)
        dragCallback: (create, edit) - Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:  global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods)  The proc returns a string array that is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type.  Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers CTRL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTRL, 3 == CTRL + SHIFT.  In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form:  def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ):  The values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above.  The other way to specify the callback in Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard Python format operator.

The "dragControl" value is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be "print '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'")
        dragCommand: (create, edit) - Command executed when dragging in the field.
        dropCallback: (create, edit) - Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:  global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int $y, int $type)  The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source.

The "dragControl" value is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be "print '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'")
        editable: (create, edit, query) - The edit state of the field.  By default, this flag is set to true and the field value may be changed by typing into it.  If false then the field cannot be changed interactively.  However, the field text can be changed using the -v/value flag regardless of the state of the -ed/editable flag.
        enable: (create, edit, query) - The enable state of the control.  By default, this flag is set to true and the control is enabled.  Specify false and the control will appear dimmed or greyed-out indicating it is disabled.

        columnWidth3: (create, edit) - Sets the column widths for all 3 columns. Ignored if there are not exactly 3 columns.
        columnWidth4: (create, edit) - Sets the column widths for all 4 columns. Ignored if there are not exactly 4 columns.
        columnWidth5: (create, edit) - Sets the column widths for all 5 columns. Ignored if there are not exactly 5 columns.
        columnWidth6: (create, edit) - Sets the column widths for all 6 columns. Ignored if there are not exactly 6 columns.
        defineTemplate: (create) - Puts the command in a mode where any other flags and arguments are parsed and added to the command template specified in the argument. They will be used as default arguments in any subsequent invocations of the command when templateName is set as the current template.
        docTag: (create, edit, query) - Add a documentation flag to the control.  The documentation flag has a directory structure. (e.g., -dt render/multiLister/createNode/material)
        dragCallback: (create, edit) - Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:  global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods)  The proc returns a string array that is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type.  Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers CTRL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTRL, 3 == CTRL + SHIFT.  In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form:  def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ):  The values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above.  The other way to specify the callback in Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys "dragControl", "x", "y", "modifiers".  The "dragControl" value is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be "print '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'")
        dragCommand: (create, edit) - Command string executed when dragging the invisible slider in any of the fields.
        dropCallback: (create, edit) - Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:  global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int $y, int $type)  The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback. $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link.  In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form:  def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ):  The values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above.  The other way to specify the callback in Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys "dragControl", "dropControl", "messages", "x", "y", "type".  The "dragControl" value is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be "print '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'")

        enableBackground: (create, edit, query) - Enables the background color of the control.
        enableKeyboardFocus: (create, edit, query) - If enabled, the user can navigate to the control with the tab key and select values with the keyboard or mouse. This flag would typically be used to turn off focus support from controls that get it by default, like Edit and List controls. If disabled, text in text fields can still be selected with the mouse but cannot be copied (except on Linux when "Middle Click Paste" is enabled).
        exists: (create) - Returns whether the specified object exists or not. Other flags are ignored.
        extraLabel: (create, edit, query) - If present on creation this specifies that there will be an extra label in the group.  Sets the string to be label text to the right of fields.
        fullPathName: (query) - Return the full path name of the widget, which includes all the parents.
        height: (create, edit, query) - The height of the control.  The control will attempt to be this size if it is not overruled by parent layout conditions.

        manage: (create, edit, query) - Manage state of the control.  An unmanaged control is not visible, nor does it take up any screen real estate.  All controls are created managed by default.
        noBackground: (create, edit) - Clear/reset the control's background. Passing true means the background should not be drawn at all, false means the background should be drawn.  The state of this flag is inherited by children of this control.
        numberOfFields: (create) - Set the number of fields on creation. One to four fields are available.  The default is one field.
        numberOfPopupMenus: (query) - Return the number of popup menus attached to this control.

        value1: (create, edit, query) - 
        value2: (create, edit, query) - 
        value3: (create, edit, query) - 
        value4: (create, edit, query) - Value for the respective field.
        visible: (create, edit, query) - The visible state of the control.  A control is created visible by default.  Note that a control's actual appearance is also dependent on the visible state of its parent layout(s).
        visibleChangeCommand: (create, edit, query) - Command that gets executed when visible state of the control changes.
        width: (create, edit, query) - The width of the control.  The control will attempt to be this size if it is not overruled by parent layout conditions.

That is, one should either use changeCommand and test the state of the control from inside the callback, or use onCommand and offCommand as separate callbacks.
        collection: (create, edit) - To explicitly add a tool button to a tool collection.
        defineTemplate: (create) - Puts the command in a mode where any other flags and arguments are parsed and added to the command template specified in the argument. They will be used as default arguments in any subsequent invocations of the command when templateName is set as the current template.
        docTag: (create, edit, query) - Add a documentation flag to the control.  The documentation flag has a directory structure. (e.g., -dt render/multiLister/createNode/material)
        doubleClickCommand: (create, edit) - Command executed when the control is double clicked.
        dragCallback: (create, edit) - Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:  global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods)  The proc returns a string array that is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type.  Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers CTRL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTRL, 3 == CTRL + SHIFT.  In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form:  def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ):  The values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above.  The other way to specify the callback in Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys "dragControl", "x", "y", "modifiers".  The "dragControl" value is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be "print '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'")
        dropCallback: (create, edit) - Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:  global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int $y, int $type)  The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback. $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link.  In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form:  def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ):  The values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above.  The other way to specify the callback in Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys "dragControl", "dropControl", "messages", "x", "y", "type".  The "dragControl" value is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be "print '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'")
        enable: (create, edit, query) - The enable state of the control.  By default, this flag is set to true and the control is enabled.  Specify false and the control will appear dimmed or greyed-out indicating it is disabled.
        enableBackground: (create, edit, query) - Enables the background color of the control.
        enableKeyboardFocus: (create, edit, query) - If enabled, the user can navigate to the control with the tab key and select values with the keyboard or mouse. This flag would typically be used to turn off focus support from controls that get it by default, like Edit and List controls. If disabled, text in text fields can still be selected with the mouse but cannot be copied (except on Linux when "Middle Click Paste" is enabled).
        exists: (create) - Returns whether the specified object exists or not. Other flags are ignored.
        fullPathName: (query) - Return the full path name of the widget, which includes all the parents.
        height: (create, edit, query) - The height of the control.  The control will attempt to be this size if it is not overruled by parent layout conditions.
        highlightColor: (create, edit, query) - The highlight color of the control. The arguments correspond to the red, green, and blue color components. Each component ranges in value from 0.0 to 1.0.
        image1: (create, edit, query) - 
        image2: (create, edit, query) - 
        image3: (create, edit, query) - This control supports three images.  The image that best fits the current size of the control will be displayed.  This flag applies the image to the current tool.
        imageOverlayLabel: (create, edit, query) - A short string (5 characters) label that will be displayed on top of the icon.
        isObscured: (query) - Return whether the control can actually be seen by the user. The control will be obscured if its state is invisible, if it is blocked (entirely or partially) by some other control, if it or a parent layout is unmanaged, or if the control's window is invisible or iconified.
        manage: (create, edit, query) - Manage state of the control.  An unmanaged control is not visible, nor does it take up any screen real estate.  All controls are created managed by default.
        noBackground: (create, edit) - Clear/reset the control's background. Passing true means the background should not be drawn at all, false means the background should be drawn.  The state of this flag is inherited by children of this control.
        numberOfPopupMenus: (query) - Return the number of popup menus attached to this control.
        offCommand: (create, edit) - Command executed when the control is turned off.
        onCommand: (create, edit) - Command executed when the control is turned on.
        parent: (create, query) - The parent layout for this control.
        popupIndicatorVisible: (create, edit, query) - Edit this flag to set the visibility of the popup tool indicator. The indicator is a simple image that appears in the top right corner of the button when more that one tool is associated with this control. This flag is queryable and true by default.
        popupMenuArray: (query) - Return the names of all the popup menus attached to this control.
        preventOverride: (create, edit, query) - If true, this flag prevents overriding the control's attribute via the control's right mouse button menu.
        select: (create, edit) - Will set this button as the selected one.  This flag also queries the select state of the control.
        statusBarMessage: (create, edit) - Extra string to display in the status bar when the mouse is over the control.
        style: (create, edit) - The draw style of the control.  Valid styles are "iconOnly", "textOnly", "iconAndTextHorizontal" and "iconAndTextVertical".
        tool: (create, edit, multiuse, query) - The name of the tool to be attached to the button.  If the tool specified is already attached to this button then it will be selected.  Query this flag to return the current tool.  This flag may be specified more than once to attach more than one tool.
        toolArray: (query) - This query only flag returns the names of all the tools attached to the toolButton control.
        toolCount: (query) - This query only flag return the number of tools attached to the toolButton control.
        toolImage1: (create, edit, multiuse, query) - 
        toolImage2: (create, edit, multiuse, query) - 
        toolImage3: (create, edit, multiuse, query) - This control supports three images.  The image that best fits the current size of the control will be displayed.  This flag applies the image to the specified tool.  The first argument is the name of the tool and the second is the name of the image.  When queried an array of tool icon pairs is returned.
        useTemplate: (create) - Forces the command to use a command template other than the current one.
        version: (create, edit, query) - Specify the version that this tool button feature was introduced. The argument should be given as a string of the version number (e.g. "2013", "2014"). Currently only accepts major version numbers (e.g. 2013 Ext 1, or 2013.5 should be given as "2014").
        visible: (create, edit, query) - The visible state of the control.  A control is created visible by default.  Note that a control's actual appearance is also dependent on the visible state of its parent layout(s).
        visibleChangeCommand: (create, edit, query) - Command that gets executed when visible state of the control changes.
        width: (create, edit, query) - The width of the control.  The control will attempt to be this size if it is not overruled by parent layout conditions.

        defineTemplate: (create) - Puts the command in a mode where any other flags and arguments are parsed and added to the command template specified in the argument. They will be used as default arguments in any subsequent invocations of the command when templateName is set as the current template.

        dragCallback: (create, edit) - Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:  global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods)  The proc returns a string array that is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type.  Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers CTRL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTRL, 3 == CTRL + SHIFT.  In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form:  def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ):  The values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above.  The other way to specify the callback in Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys "dragControl", "x", "y", "modifiers".  The "dragControl" value is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be "print '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'")
        dropCallback: (create, edit) - Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:  global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int $y, int $type)  The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback. $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link.  In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form:  def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ):  The values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above.  The other way to specify the callback in Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys "dragControl", "dropControl", "messages", "x", "y", "type".  The "dragControl" value is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be "print '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'")
        editLabelCommand: (create, edit) - Set the callback function to be invoked when the user changes the name of an item by double clicking it in the UI. The callback should accept two string arguments: the item name and the new name. The item name refers to the name of the item and not the display label. The callback function should return a string. An empty string indicates that the rename operation was invalid and the control should revert to the original name. If the rename operation is valid the callback should return a string that identifies the item, possibly different from the new display name entered by the user.
        enable: (create, edit, query) - The enable state of the control.  By default, this flag is set to true and the control is enabled.  Specify false and the control will appear dimmed or greyed-out indicating it is disabled.

        enableButton: (create, edit, multiuse) - Sets a specific button on a specific item to being usable or not. First argument specifies the item, second argument specifies the button, third argument specifies on or off.
        enableKeyboardFocus: (create, edit, query) - If enabled, the user can navigate to the control with the tab key and select values with the keyboard or mouse. This flag would typically be used to turn off focus support from controls that get it by default, like Edit and List controls. If disabled, text in text fields can still be selected with the mouse but cannot be copied (except on Linux when "Middle Click Paste" is enabled).
        enableKeys: (edit) - By default the treeview does not accept input from the keyboard.  By enabling keyboard support The treeview will support up/down navigation using the up/down arrow keys.

    This command is obsolete and will be removed in next version of Maya. The internal web browser of Maya has been replaced by a plug-in which allows your own browser to connect with Maya. Please refer help for information on how to setup communication of Maya with external web browser application.

    Args:
        annotation: (create, edit, query) - Annotate the control with an extra string value.
        back: (create) - Go back a page
        backgroundColor: (create, edit, query) - The background color of the control. The arguments correspond to the red, green, and blue color components. Each component ranges in value from 0.0 to 1.0. When setting backgroundColor, the background is automatically enabled, unless enableBackground is also specified with a false value.
        defineTemplate: (create) - Puts the command in a mode where any other flags and arguments are parsed and added to the command template specified in the argument. They will be used as default arguments in any subsequent invocations of the command when templateName is set as the current template.
        docTag: (create, edit, query) - Add a documentation flag to the control.  The documentation flag has a directory structure. (e.g., -dt render/multiLister/createNode/material)
        dragCallback: (create, edit) - Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:  global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods)  The proc returns a string array that is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type.  Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers CTRL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTRL, 3 == CTRL + SHIFT.  In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form:  def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ):  The values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above.  The other way to specify the callback in Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys "dragControl", "x", "y", "modifiers".  The "dragControl" value is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be "print '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'")
        dropCallback: (create, edit) - Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:  global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int $y, int $type)  The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback. $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link.  In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form:  def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ):  The values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above.  The other way to specify the callback in Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys "dragControl", "dropControl", "messages", "x", "y", "type".  The "dragControl" value is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be "print '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'")
        enable: (create, edit, query) - The enable state of the control.  By default, this flag is set to true and the control is enabled.  Specify false and the control will appear dimmed or greyed-out indicating it is disabled.
        enableBackground: (create, edit, query) - Enables the background color of the control.
        enableKeyboardFocus: (create, edit, query) - If enabled, the user can navigate to the control with the tab key and select values with the keyboard or mouse. This flag would typically be used to turn off focus support from controls that get it by default, like Edit and List controls. If disabled, text in text fields can still be selected with the mouse but cannot be copied (except on Linux when "Middle Click Paste" is enabled).
        exists: (create) - Returns whether the specified object exists or not. Other flags are ignored.
        find: (create) - Find text in a page
        forward: (create) - Go forward a page
        fullPathName: (query) - Return the full path name of the widget, which includes all the parents.
        height: (create, edit, query) - The height of the control.  The control will attempt to be this size if it is not overruled by parent layout conditions.
        highlightColor: (create, edit, query) - The highlight color of the control. The arguments correspond to the red, green, and blue color components. Each component ranges in value from 0.0 to 1.0.
        home: (create) - Go to the home page
        isObscured: (query) - Return whether the control can actually be seen by the user. The control will be obscured if its state is invisible, if it is blocked (entirely or partially) by some other control, if it or a parent layout is unmanaged, or if the control's window is invisible or iconified.
        manage: (create, edit, query) - Manage state of the control.  An unmanaged control is not visible, nor does it take up any screen real estate.  All controls are created managed by default.
        matchCase: (create) - True if the match should respect the case
        matchWholeWorld: (create) - True if the match should check the whole world
        noBackground: (create, edit) - Clear/reset the control's background. Passing true means the background should not be drawn at all, false means the background should be drawn.  The state of this flag is inherited by children of this control.
        numberOfPopupMenus: (query) - Return the number of popup menus attached to this control.
        openURL: (create, edit, query) - Open the named URL
        parent: (create, query) - The parent layout for this control.
        popupMenuArray: (query) - Return the names of all the popup menus attached to this control.
        preventOverride: (create, edit, query) - If true, this flag prevents overriding the control's attribute via the control's right mouse button menu.
        reload: (create) - Reload the current page
        searchForward: (create) - True if search should be going forward from the current location
        statusBarMessage: (create, edit) - Extra string to display in the status bar when the mouse is over the control.
        stop: (create) - Stop loading a page
        urlChangedCb: (create) - Command to call when the URL changes
        useTemplate: (create) - Forces the command to use a command template other than the current one.
        visible: (create, edit, query) - The visible state of the control.  A control is created visible by default.  Note that a control's actual appearance is also dependent on the visible state of its parent layout(s).
        visibleChangeCommand: (create, edit, query) - Command that gets executed when visible state of the control changes.
        width: (create, edit, query) - The width of the control.  The control will attempt to be this size if it is not overruled by parent layout conditions.
        wrap: (create) - Set to true if the page should wrap

    This command creates a new window but leaves it invisible. It is most efficient to add the window's elements and then make it visible with the showWindow command. The window can have an optional menu bar. Also, the title bar and minimize/maximize buttons can be turned on or off. If the title bar is off, then you cannot have minimize or maximize buttons.

    Args:
        backgroundColor: (create, edit) - The background color of the window. The arguments correspond to the red, green, and blue color components. Each component ranges in value from 0.0 to 1.0.
        closeCommand: (create, edit) - Script executed after the window is closed.
        defineTemplate: (create) - Puts the command in a mode where any other flags and arguments are parsed and added to the command template specified in the argument. They will be used as default arguments in any subsequent invocations of the command when templateName is set as the current template.
        docTag: (create, edit, query) - Attach a tag to the window.
        dockCorner: (create, multiuse) - Specifies which docking areas occupied the four different corners of the window. By default docking windows on the bottom or top will span the whole window. Use multiple instances of this flag to allow the left and right docking areas to occupy the corners. This method has two arguments: docking corner and docking area. Possible values for docking corner are "topLeft", "topRight", bottomLeft", and "bottomRight". Possible values for docking area are "left", "right", "top", and "bottom".
        dockStation: (create) - When set this flag specifies that this window can contain other docked sub-windows.
        dockingLayout: (create, edit, query) - When queried this flag will return a string holding the docking layout information. This string can be set when creating or editing a docking station to restore the previous docking layout. This string is a hexadecimal representation of a binary string and is not meant to be humanly readable, but can be saved and loaded using the optionVar command to restore layouts across sessions of Maya.
        exists: (create) - Returns whether the specified object exists or not. Other flags are ignored.
        frontWindow: (query) - Return the name of the front window.  Note: you must supply the name of any window (the window does not need to exist). Returns "unknown" if the front window cannot be determined.
        height: (create, edit, query) - Height of the window excluding any window frame in pixels.
        iconName: (create, edit, query) - The window's icon title.  By default it is the same as the window's title.
        iconify: (create, edit, query) - Icon state of the window.

        leftEdge: (create, edit, query) - Position of the left edge of the window.
        mainMenuBar: (create, edit, query) - If this flag is used then the main menu bar will be enabled.
        mainWindow: (create, edit, query) - Main window for the application.  The main window has an 'Exit' item in the Window Manager menu.  By default, the first created window becomes the main window.
        maximizeButton: (create, edit, query) - Turns the window's maximize button on or off.
        menuArray: (query) - Return a string array containing the names of the menus in the window's menu bar.
        menuBar: (create, query) - Adds an empty menu bar to the window. The Qt name of the object will be m_menubar_nameOfTheWindow.
        menuBarCornerWidget: (edit, query) - This flag specifies a widget to add to a corner of the parent window. The first argument corresponds to the widget name and the second to the position of the widget. Possible values for widget position are "topLeft", "topRight", "bottomLeft", "bottomRight". In query mode this flag returns all the corner widget names in the following order: topLeft, topRight, bottomLeft, bottomRight. Add the -mbr/-menuBarResize flag to the changeCommand of widget passed (first argument) so that it will always have an appropriate size.
        menuBarResize: (edit) - This flag should be used with the -mcw/-menuBarCornerWidget flag. This is used to resize the menu bar so that the corner widgets are updated.
        menuBarVisible: (create, edit, query) - Visibility of the menu bar (if there is one).
        menuIndex: (edit) - Sets the index of a specified menu.

        numberOfMenus: (query) - Return the number of menus attached to the window's menu bar.
        parent: (create) - Specifies a parent window or layout which the created window is always on top of. Note: If the parent is a window the created window is not modal, so events are still propagated to the parent window.
        resizeToFitChildren: (create, edit, query) - The window will always grow/shrink to just fit the controls it contains.
        restoreCommand: (create, edit) - Script executed after the window is restored from it's minimized (iconified) state.

The mel command should take the form:  global proc callbackName(string $workspaceControlName)  If "save" is appended to the command name, it will be called during the layout save.  global proc callbackNameSave(string $workspaceControlName)
        initialHeight: (create, edit) - The initial height of the workspace control when first shown.
        initialWidth: (create, edit) - The initial width of the workspace control when first shown.
        label: (create, edit, query) - The label text. The default label is the name of the workspace control.
        layoutDirectionCallback: (create, edit, query) - Set a mel procedure to be called when the control changes orientation. The procedure is called with argument 1 for horizontal and 0 for vertical.
        loadImmediately: (create, edit) - Sets whether the UI (as defined by the uiScript) will be built immediately on workspace control creation (true) or delayed until the control is actually shown (false). Default value is false.
        minimumHeight: (create, edit, query) - Sets the minimum height of control to the given value.  If given value is 0 (False), minimum height is set to 0. If given value is 1 (True), minimum height is set to initial height. If given value is greater than 1, minimum height is set to the given value.  In query mode returns current minimum height of the control.
        minimumWidth: (create, edit, query) - Sets the minimum width of control to the given value. This flag parameter was changed from bool to int in 2018 and old settings are still respected according to the following.  If given value is 0 (False), minimum width is set to 0. If given value is 1 (True), minimum width is set to initial width. If given value is greater than 1, minimum width is set to the given value.  In query mode returns current minimum width of the control.
        r: (edit, query) - Raises a workspace control to the top and makes it active. In Query mode, this flag will return whether the workspace control is active or not. Note that this flag won't raise a control if is minimized or collapsed. Use the flag -rs/restore instead.
        requiredControl: (create, edit, multiuse) - The name of a workspace control that needs to be open in order for this workspace control to properly function. This workspace control will not be created if the required control is not open, and will be closed when the required control is closed.
        requiredPlugin: (create, edit, multiuse) - The name of a plug-in that needs to be loaded in order to build the workspace control UI.
        resizeHeight: (edit) - Resizes a floating workspace control's height to the given value.
        resizeWidth: (edit) - Resizes a floating workspace control's width to the given value.
        restore: (create, edit) - Restores the control according to the following rules:  If collapsed then the control will be expanded If hidden then the control will be shown If minimized then the control will be restored If the control is an inactive tab into a tab group then it will become the active tab
        retain: (create) - Sets whether the workspace control is retained (i.e. only hidden) or deleted when closed. Default value is true.
        stateString: (create, edit, query) - String containing the state of the control. Can be used with the initCallback flag.
        tabPosition: (create, edit, query) - Changes the tab position. The possible values are: "north", "east" and "west". The boolean value, if set to true, changes the tab positions of all the controls in the parent widget. If it is not set, only the current control will get its position changed. A control can have a different orientation than the tab widget. If the control tab position is different from the tab widget's one, the tab position will be changed when the control becomes the only control in the tab widget. On query, only the control's tab position will be returned, not the tab widget's position. They may differ.
        tabToControl: (create, edit) - Tab this workspace control into the given control. The first argument is the control name, the second is the index position within the containing tab widget (invalid values mean append).
        uiScript: (create, edit) - The specified script will be invoked to build the UI of the workspaceControl.  This is a required flag.
        useTemplate: (create) - Forces the command to use a command template other than the current one.
        visible: (create, edit, query) - The visible state of the workspace control. A control is created visible by default. If the control is created as not visible, the control will be created in a closed state. To make it appear, edit the control to set the flags floating or the flag visible to true. Use -r/raise flag to get the active status of a control as this flag will return true when the control is minimized or collapsed.
        visibleChangeCommand: (create, edit) - Command that gets executed when visible state of the workspace control changes.
        width: (query) - Query only flag returning the current width of the control.
        widthProperty: (create, edit, query) - Set width property of the workspace control. Valid values are:  fixed	  - Cannot be resized manually and will not be given any extra space while maximizing/dynamically resizing preferred - Can be resized manually but will not be given any extra space while maximizing/dynamically resizing free	  - Can be resized manually and will be given extra space while maximizing/dynamically resizing  Default: free  In query mode returns the current width property of the workspace control.
