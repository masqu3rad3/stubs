    The curve align command is used to align curves in maya. The main alignment options are positional, tangent and curvature continuity. Curvature continuity implies tangent continuity.

The Waiting-Normal (3), Waiting-HasNoEffect (4), Waiting-Blocking (5) are for internal use only. They temporarily shut off parts of the graph during interaction (e.g., manipulation). The understanding is that once the operation is done, the state will be reset appropriately, e.g. Waiting-Blocking will reset back to Blocking.    The Normal and Blocking cases apply to all nodes, while HasNoEffect is node specific; many nodes do not support this option. Plug-ins store state in the MPxNode::state attribute. Anyone can set it or check this attribute.  Additional details about each of these 3 states follow.     State Description   Normal The normal node state. This is the default.   HasNoEffect   The HasNoEffect option (a.k.a. pass-through), is used in cases where there is an operation on an input producing an output of the same data type. Nearly all deformers support this state, as do a few other nodes. As stated earlier, it is not supported by all nodes.   It’s typical to implement support for the HasNoEffect state in the node’s compute method and to perform appropriate operations. Plug-ins can also support HasNoEffect.   The usual implementation of this state is to copy the input directly to the matching output without applying the algorithm in the node. For deformers, applying this state leaves the input geometry undeformed on the output.     Blocking   This is implemented in the depend node base class and applies to all nodes. Blocking is applied during the evaluation phase to connections. An evaluation request to a blocked connection will return as failures, causing the destination plug to retain its current value. Dirty propagation is indirectly affected by this state since blocked connections are never cleaned.   When a node is set to Blocking the behavior is supposed to be the same as if all outgoing connections were broken. As long as nobody requests evaluation of the blocked node directly it won’t evaluate after that. Note that a blocked node will still respond to getAttr requests but a getAttr on a downstream node will not reevaluate the blocked node.   Setting the root transform of a hierarchy to Blocking won’t automatically influence child transforms in the hierarchy. To do this, you’d need to explicitly set all child nodes to the Blocking state.   For example, to set all child transforms to Blocking, you could use the following script.    import maya.cmds as cmds def blockTree(root): nodesToBlock = [] for node in {child:1 for child in cmds.listRelatives( root, path=True, allDescendents=True )}.keys(): nodesToBlock += cmds.listConnections(node, source=True, destination=True ) for node in {source:1 for source in nodesToBlock}.keys(): cmds.setAttr( '%s.nodeState' % node, 2 )    Applying this script would continue to draw objects but things would not be animated.     Default: kdnNormal
        positionalContinuity: (create, edit, query) - Positional continuity is on if true and off otherwise. Default: true
        positionalContinuityType: (create, edit, query) - Positional continuity type legal values: 1 - move first curve, 2 - move second curve, 3 - move both curves, 4 - modify first curve, 5 - modify second curve, 6 - modify both curves Default: 1
        reverse1: (create, edit, query) - If true, reverse the first input curve before doing align. Otherwise, do nothing to the first input curve before aligning. NOTE: setting this attribute to random values will cause unpredictable results and is not supported. Default: false
        reverse2: (create, edit, query) - If true, reverse the second input curve before doing align. Otherwise, do nothing to the second input curve before aligning. NOTE: setting this attribute to random values will cause unpredictable results and is not supported. Default: false

Once a blind data type is created, blind data of that type may be assigned using the polyBlindData command. Note that as well as polygon components, blind data may be assigned to objects and to NURBS patches. A blind data type may not be modified after it is created: in order to do so it must be deleted and recreated. Any existing blind data of that type would also need to be deleted and recreated. When used with the query flag, this command will return information about the attributes of the specified blind data type.

    Args:
        dataType: (create, multiuse) - Specifies the dataTypes that are part of BlindData node being created. Allowable strings are "int", "float", "double", "string", "boolean" and "binary". Must be used togeter with the -ldn and -sdn flags to specify each attribute.
        longDataName: (create, multiuse) - Specifies the long names of the datas that are part of BlindData node being created. Must be used togeter with the -dt and -sdn flags to specify each attribute.
        longNames: (create) - Specifies that for a query command the long attributes names be listed.
        query: (create) - Specifies that this is a special query type command.
        shortDataName: (create, multiuse) - Specifies the short names of the data that are part of BlindData node being created. Must be used togeter with the -dt and -ldn flags to specify each attribute.
        shortNames: (create) - Specifies that for a query command the short attribute names be listed.
        typeId: (create) - Specifies the typeId of the BlindData type being created.

    This command produces a boundary surface given 3 or 4 curves. This resulting boundary surface passes through two of the given curves in one direction, while in the other direction the shape is defined by the remaining curve(s).  If the "endPoint" option is on, then the curve endpoints must touch before a surface will be created.   This is the usual situation where a boundary surface is useful.

    Args:
        caching: (create, edit, query) - Toggle caching for all attributes so that no recomputation is needed
        endPoint: (create, edit, query) - True means the curve ends must touch before a surface will be created. Default: false
        endPointTolerance: (create, edit, query) - Tolerance for end points, only used if endPoint attribute is true. Default: 0.1
        nodeState: (create, edit, query) - Maya dependency nodes have 6 possible states. The Normal (0), HasNoEffect (1), and Blocking (2) states can be used to alter how the graph is evaluated.    The Waiting-Normal (3), Waiting-HasNoEffect (4), Waiting-Blocking (5) are for internal use only. They temporarily shut off parts of the graph during interaction (e.g., manipulation). The understanding is that once the operation is done, the state will be reset appropriately, e.g. Waiting-Blocking will reset back to Blocking.    The Normal and Blocking cases apply to all nodes, while HasNoEffect is node specific; many nodes do not support this option. Plug-ins store state in the MPxNode::state attribute. Anyone can set it or check this attribute.  Additional details about each of these 3 states follow.     State Description   Normal The normal node state. This is the default.   HasNoEffect   The HasNoEffect option (a.k.a. pass-through), is used in cases where there is an operation on an input producing an output of the same data type. Nearly all deformers support this state, as do a few other nodes. As stated earlier, it is not supported by all nodes.   It’s typical to implement support for the HasNoEffect state in the node’s compute method and to perform appropriate operations. Plug-ins can also support HasNoEffect.   The usual implementation of this state is to copy the input directly to the matching output without applying the algorithm in the node. For deformers, applying this state leaves the input geometry undeformed on the output.     Blocking   This is implemented in the depend node base class and applies to all nodes. Blocking is applied during the evaluation phase to connections. An evaluation request to a blocked connection will return as failures, causing the destination plug to retain its current value. Dirty propagation is indirectly affected by this state since blocked connections are never cleaned.   When a node is set to Blocking the behavior is supposed to be the same as if all outgoing connections were broken. As long as nobody requests evaluation of the blocked node directly it won’t evaluate after that. Note that a blocked node will still respond to getAttr requests but a getAttr on a downstream node will not reevaluate the blocked node.   Setting the root transform of a hierarchy to Blocking won’t automatically influence child transforms in the hierarchy. To do this, you’d need to explicitly set all child nodes to the Blocking state.   For example, to set all child transforms to Blocking, you could use the following script.    import maya.cmds as cmds def blockTree(root): nodesToBlock = [] for node in {child:1 for child in cmds.listRelatives( root, path=True, allDescendents=True )}.keys(): nodesToBlock += cmds.listConnections(node, source=True, destination=True ) for node in {source:1 for source in nodesToBlock}.keys(): cmds.setAttr( '%s.nodeState' % node, 2 )    Applying this script would continue to draw objects but things would not be animated.

        constructionHistory: (create) - Turn the construction history on or off.
        name: (create) - Sets the name of the newly-created node. If it contains namespace path, the new node will be created under the specified namespace; if the namespace does not exist, it will be created.
        object: (create) - Create the result, or just the dependency node.

    The cone command creates a new cone and/or a dependency node that creates one, and returns their names.

        endSweep: (create, edit, query) - The angle at which to end the surface of revolution. Default is 2Pi radians, or 360 degrees. Default: 6.2831853
        heightRatio: (create, edit, query) - Ratio of "height" to "width" Default: 2.0
        nodeState: (create, edit, query) - Maya dependency nodes have 6 possible states. The Normal (0), HasNoEffect (1), and Blocking (2) states can be used to alter how the graph is evaluated.    The Waiting-Normal (3), Waiting-HasNoEffect (4), Waiting-Blocking (5) are for internal use only. They temporarily shut off parts of the graph during interaction (e.g., manipulation). The understanding is that once the operation is done, the state will be reset appropriately, e.g. Waiting-Blocking will reset back to Blocking.    The Normal and Blocking cases apply to all nodes, while HasNoEffect is node specific; many nodes do not support this option. Plug-ins store state in the MPxNode::state attribute. Anyone can set it or check this attribute.  Additional details about each of these 3 states follow.     State Description   Normal The normal node state. This is the default.   HasNoEffect   The HasNoEffect option (a.k.a. pass-through), is used in cases where there is an operation on an input producing an output of the same data type. Nearly all deformers support this state, as do a few other nodes. As stated earlier, it is not supported by all nodes.   It’s typical to implement support for the HasNoEffect state in the node’s compute method and to perform appropriate operations. Plug-ins can also support HasNoEffect.   The usual implementation of this state is to copy the input directly to the matching output without applying the algorithm in the node. For deformers, applying this state leaves the input geometry undeformed on the output.     Blocking   This is implemented in the depend node base class and applies to all nodes. Blocking is applied during the evaluation phase to connections. An evaluation request to a blocked connection will return as failures, causing the destination plug to retain its current value. Dirty propagation is indirectly affected by this state since blocked connections are never cleaned.   When a node is set to Blocking the behavior is supposed to be the same as if all outgoing connections were broken. As long as nobody requests evaluation of the blocked node directly it won’t evaluate after that. Note that a blocked node will still respond to getAttr requests but a getAttr on a downstream node will not reevaluate the blocked node.   Setting the root transform of a hierarchy to Blocking won’t automatically influence child transforms in the hierarchy. To do this, you’d need to explicitly set all child nodes to the Blocking state.   For example, to set all child transforms to Blocking, you could use the following script.    import maya.cmds as cmds def blockTree(root): nodesToBlock = [] for node in {child:1 for child in cmds.listRelatives( root, path=True, allDescendents=True )}.keys(): nodesToBlock += cmds.listConnections(node, source=True, destination=True ) for node in {source:1 for source in nodesToBlock}.keys(): cmds.setAttr( '%s.nodeState' % node, 2 )    Applying this script would continue to draw objects but things would not be animated.

        radius: (create, edit, query) - The radius of the object Default: 1.0
        sections: (create, edit, query) - The number of sections determines the resolution of the surface in the sweep direction. Used only if useTolerance is false. Default: 8
        spans: (create, edit, query) - The number of spans determines the resolution of the surface in the opposite direction. Default: 1
        startSweep: (create, edit, query) - The angle at which to start the surface of revolution Default: 0
        tolerance: (create, edit, query) - The tolerance with which to build the surface. Used only if useTolerance is true Default: 0.01

    The detachSurface command detaches a surface into pieces, given a list of parameter values and a direction.  You can also specify which pieces to keep and which to discard using the "-k" flag. The names of the newly detached surface(s) are returned.  If history is on, the name of the resulting dependency node is also returned.

    Args:
        caching: (create, edit, query) - Toggle caching for all attributes so that no recomputation is needed
        direction: (create, edit, query) - Direction in which to detach: 0 - V direction, 1 - U direction Default: 1

The Waiting-Normal (3), Waiting-HasNoEffect (4), Waiting-Blocking (5) are for internal use only. They temporarily shut off parts of the graph during interaction (e.g., manipulation). The understanding is that once the operation is done, the state will be reset appropriately, e.g. Waiting-Blocking will reset back to Blocking.    The Normal and Blocking cases apply to all nodes, while HasNoEffect is node specific; many nodes do not support this option. Plug-ins store state in the MPxNode::state attribute. Anyone can set it or check this attribute.  Additional details about each of these 3 states follow.     State Description   Normal The normal node state. This is the default.   HasNoEffect   The HasNoEffect option (a.k.a. pass-through), is used in cases where there is an operation on an input producing an output of the same data type. Nearly all deformers support this state, as do a few other nodes. As stated earlier, it is not supported by all nodes.   It’s typical to implement support for the HasNoEffect state in the node’s compute method and to perform appropriate operations. Plug-ins can also support HasNoEffect.   The usual implementation of this state is to copy the input directly to the matching output without applying the algorithm in the node. For deformers, applying this state leaves the input geometry undeformed on the output.     Blocking   This is implemented in the depend node base class and applies to all nodes. Blocking is applied during the evaluation phase to connections. An evaluation request to a blocked connection will return as failures, causing the destination plug to retain its current value. Dirty propagation is indirectly affected by this state since blocked connections are never cleaned.   When a node is set to Blocking the behavior is supposed to be the same as if all outgoing connections were broken. As long as nobody requests evaluation of the blocked node directly it won’t evaluate after that. Note that a blocked node will still respond to getAttr requests but a getAttr on a downstream node will not reevaluate the blocked node.   Setting the root transform of a hierarchy to Blocking won’t automatically influence child transforms in the hierarchy. To do this, you’d need to explicitly set all child nodes to the Blocking state.   For example, to set all child transforms to Blocking, you could use the following script.    import maya.cmds as cmds def blockTree(root): nodesToBlock = [] for node in {child:1 for child in cmds.listRelatives( root, path=True, allDescendents=True )}.keys(): nodesToBlock += cmds.listConnections(node, source=True, destination=True ) for node in {source:1 for source in nodesToBlock}.keys(): cmds.setAttr( '%s.nodeState' % node, 2 )    Applying this script would continue to draw objects but things would not be animated.

        remove: (create) - If the remove flag is set then the metadata will be removed rather than have values set. In this mode the "memberName", "value", and "stringValue" flags are ignored. "memberName" is ignored because when deleting metadata all members of a structure must be removed as a group. The others are ignored since when deleting you don't need a value to be set.
        stringValue: (create, multiuse) - String value to be set into the specified metadata locations. This flag can only be used when the data member is a numeric type. If the member has N dimensions (e.g. string[2]) then this flag must appear N times (e.g. 2 times) The same values are applied to the specified metadata member on all affected components or metadata indices. Only one of the value, and stringValue flags can be specified at once and the type must match the type of the structure member named by the "member" flag.
        value: (create, multiuse) - Numeric value to be set into the specified metadata locations. This flag can only be used when the data member is a numeric type. If the member has N dimensions (e.g. float[3]) then this flag must appear N times (e.g. 3 times) The same values are applied to the specified metadata member on all affected components or metadata indices. All numeric member types should use this type of value specification, i.e. everything except string and matrix types. Only one of the value, and stringValue flags can be specified at once and the type must match the type of the structure member named by the "member" flag.
        channelName: (create, query) - Filter the metadata selection to only recognize metadata belonging to the specified named Channel (e.g. "vertex"). This flag is ignored if the components on the selection list are being used to specify the metadata of interest. 			In query mode, this flag can accept a value.
        channelType: (create, query) - Obsolete - use the 'channelName' flag instead. 			In query mode, this flag can accept a value.
        endIndex: (create) - The metadata is stored in a Stream, which is an indexed list. If you have mesh components selected then the metadata indices are implicit in the list of selected components. If you select only the node or scene then this flag may be used in conjunction with the startIndex flag to specify a range of indices from which to retrieve the metadata. It is an error to have the value of startIndex be greater than that of endIndex.   See also the index flag for an alternate way to specify multiple indices. This flag can only be used on index types that support a range (e.g. integer values - it makes no sense to request a range between two strings)  			In query mode, this flag can accept a value.
        index: (create, multiuse, query) - In the typical case metadata is indexed using a simple integer value. Certain types of data may use other index types. e.g. a "vertexFace" component will use a "pair" index type, which is two integer values; one for the face ID of the component and the second for the vertex ID.   The index flag takes a string, formatted in the way the specified indexType requires. All uses of the index flag have the same indexType. If the type was not specified it is assumed to be a simple integer value.  			In query mode, this flag can accept a value.
        indexType: (create, query) - Name of the index type the new Channel should be using. If not specified this defaults to a simple integer index. Of the native types only a mesh "vertexFace" channel is different, using a "pair" index type. 			In query mode, this flag can accept a value.
        scene: (create, query) - Use this flag when you want to add metadata to the scene as a whole rather than to any individual nodes. If you use this flag and have nodes selected the nodes will be ignored and a warning will be displayed.
        startIndex: (create) - The metadata is stored in a Stream, which is an indexed list. If you have mesh components selected then the metadata indices are implicit in the list of selected components.

The understanding is that once the operation is done, the state will be reset appropriately, e.g. Waiting-Blocking will reset back to Blocking.    The Normal and Blocking cases apply to all nodes, while HasNoEffect is node specific; many nodes do not support this option. Plug-ins store state in the MPxNode::state attribute. Anyone can set it or check this attribute.  Additional details about each of these 3 states follow.     State Description   Normal The normal node state. This is the default.   HasNoEffect   The HasNoEffect option (a.k.a. pass-through), is used in cases where there is an operation on an input producing an output of the same data type. Nearly all deformers support this state, as do a few other nodes. As stated earlier, it is not supported by all nodes.   It’s typical to implement support for the HasNoEffect state in the node’s compute method and to perform appropriate operations. Plug-ins can also support HasNoEffect.   The usual implementation of this state is to copy the input directly to the matching output without applying the algorithm in the node. For deformers, applying this state leaves the input geometry undeformed on the output.     Blocking   This is implemented in the depend node base class and applies to all nodes. Blocking is applied during the evaluation phase to connections. An evaluation request to a blocked connection will return as failures, causing the destination plug to retain its current value. Dirty propagation is indirectly affected by this state since blocked connections are never cleaned.   When a node is set to Blocking the behavior is supposed to be the same as if all outgoing connections were broken. As long as nobody requests evaluation of the blocked node directly it won’t evaluate after that. Note that a blocked node will still respond to getAttr requests but a getAttr on a downstream node will not reevaluate the blocked node.   Setting the root transform of a hierarchy to Blocking won’t automatically influence child transforms in the hierarchy. To do this, you’d need to explicitly set all child nodes to the Blocking state.

    This command computes a surface given a profile curve and possibly a path curve. There are three ways to extrude a profile curve. The most basic method is called a "distance" extrude where direction and length are specified. No path curve is necessary in this case. The second method is called "flat" extrude. This method sweeps the profile curve down the path curve without changing the orientation of the profile curve. Finally, the third method is called "tube" extrude.

The Normal and Blocking cases apply to all nodes, while HasNoEffect is node specific; many nodes do not support this option. Plug-ins store state in the MPxNode::state attribute. Anyone can set it or check this attribute.  Additional details about each of these 3 states follow.     State Description   Normal The normal node state. This is the default.   HasNoEffect   The HasNoEffect option (a.k.a. pass-through), is used in cases where there is an operation on an input producing an output of the same data type. Nearly all deformers support this state, as do a few other nodes. As stated earlier, it is not supported by all nodes.   It’s typical to implement support for the HasNoEffect state in the node’s compute method and to perform appropriate operations. Plug-ins can also support HasNoEffect.   The usual implementation of this state is to copy the input directly to the matching output without applying the algorithm in the node. For deformers, applying this state leaves the input geometry undeformed on the output.     Blocking   This is implemented in the depend node base class and applies to all nodes. Blocking is applied during the evaluation phase to connections. An evaluation request to a blocked connection will return as failures, causing the destination plug to retain its current value. Dirty propagation is indirectly affected by this state since blocked connections are never cleaned.   When a node is set to Blocking the behavior is supposed to be the same as if all outgoing connections were broken. As long as nobody requests evaluation of the blocked node directly it won’t evaluate after that. Note that a blocked node will still respond to getAttr requests but a getAttr on a downstream node will not reevaluate the blocked node.

        nodeState: (create, edit, query) - Maya dependency nodes have 6 possible states. The Normal (0), HasNoEffect (1), and Blocking (2) states can be used to alter how the graph is evaluated.    The Waiting-Normal (3), Waiting-HasNoEffect (4), Waiting-Blocking (5) are for internal use only. They temporarily shut off parts of the graph during interaction (e.g., manipulation). The understanding is that once the operation is done, the state will be reset appropriately, e.g. Waiting-Blocking will reset back to Blocking.    The Normal and Blocking cases apply to all nodes, while HasNoEffect is node specific; many nodes do not support this option. Plug-ins store state in the MPxNode::state attribute. Anyone can set it or check this attribute.  Additional details about each of these 3 states follow.     State Description   Normal The normal node state. This is the default.   HasNoEffect   The HasNoEffect option (a.k.a. pass-through), is used in cases where there is an operation on an input producing an output of the same data type. Nearly all deformers support this state, as do a few other nodes. As stated earlier, it is not supported by all nodes.   It’s typical to implement support for the HasNoEffect state in the node’s compute method and to perform appropriate operations. Plug-ins can also support HasNoEffect.   The usual implementation of this state is to copy the input directly to the matching output without applying the algorithm in the node. For deformers, applying this state leaves the input geometry undeformed on the output.     Blocking   This is implemented in the depend node base class and applies to all nodes. Blocking is applied during the evaluation phase to connections. An evaluation request to a blocked connection will return as failures, causing the destination plug to retain its current value. Dirty propagation is indirectly affected by this state since blocked connections are never cleaned.   When a node is set to Blocking the behavior is supposed to be the same as if all outgoing connections were broken. As long as nobody requests evaluation of the blocked node directly it won’t evaluate after that. Note that a blocked node will still respond to getAttr requests but a getAttr on a downstream node will not reevaluate the blocked node.   Setting the root transform of a hierarchy to Blocking won’t automatically influence child transforms in the hierarchy. To do this, you’d need to explicitly set all child nodes to the Blocking state.   For example, to set all child transforms to Blocking, you could use the following script.    import maya.cmds as cmds def blockTree(root): nodesToBlock = [] for node in {child:1 for child in cmds.listRelatives( root, path=True, allDescendents=True )}.keys(): nodesToBlock += cmds.listConnections(node, source=True, destination=True ) for node in {source:1 for source in nodesToBlock}.keys(): cmds.setAttr( '%s.nodeState' % node, 2 )    Applying this script would continue to draw objects but things would not be animated.

The Normal and Blocking cases apply to all nodes, while HasNoEffect is node specific; many nodes do not support this option. Plug-ins store state in the MPxNode::state attribute. Anyone can set it or check this attribute.  Additional details about each of these 3 states follow.     State Description   Normal The normal node state. This is the default.   HasNoEffect   The HasNoEffect option (a.k.a. pass-through), is used in cases where there is an operation on an input producing an output of the same data type. Nearly all deformers support this state, as do a few other nodes. As stated earlier, it is not supported by all nodes.   It’s typical to implement support for the HasNoEffect state in the node’s compute method and to perform appropriate operations. Plug-ins can also support HasNoEffect.   The usual implementation of this state is to copy the input directly to the matching output without applying the algorithm in the node. For deformers, applying this state leaves the input geometry undeformed on the output.     Blocking   This is implemented in the depend node base class and applies to all nodes. Blocking is applied during the evaluation phase to connections. An evaluation request to a blocked connection will return as failures, causing the destination plug to retain its current value. Dirty propagation is indirectly affected by this state since blocked connections are never cleaned.   When a node is set to Blocking the behavior is supposed to be the same as if all outgoing connections were broken. As long as nobody requests evaluation of the blocked node directly it won’t evaluate after that. Note that a blocked node will still respond to getAttr requests but a getAttr on a downstream node will not reevaluate the blocked node.   Setting the root transform of a hierarchy to Blocking won’t automatically influence child transforms in the hierarchy. To do this, you’d need to explicitly set all child nodes to the Blocking state.   For example, to set all child transforms to Blocking, you could use the following script.    import maya.cmds as cmds def blockTree(root): nodesToBlock = [] for node in {child:1 for child in cmds.listRelatives( root, path=True, allDescendents=True )}.keys(): nodesToBlock += cmds.listConnections(node, source=True, destination=True ) for node in {source:1 for source in nodesToBlock}.keys(): cmds.setAttr( '%s.nodeState' % node, 2 )    Applying this script would continue to draw objects but things would not be animated.

If construction history is off then the operation will be performed directly on the object.  Note: If the object already has construction history then this flag is ignored and the node will always be inserted into the history chain.
        createNewMap: (create) - Set to true if a new map should be created
        insertBeforeDeformers: (create) - Set to true if the new node created should inserted before any deformer nodes.
        layout: (create, edit, query) - What layout algorithm should be used: 0 UV pieces are set to no layout. 1 UV pieces are aligned along the U axis. 2 UV pieces are moved in a square shape.
        name: (create) - Give a name to the resulting node.
        nodeState: (create, edit, query) - Maya dependency nodes have 6 possible states. The Normal (0), HasNoEffect (1), and Blocking (2) states can be used to alter how the graph is evaluated.    The Waiting-Normal (3), Waiting-HasNoEffect (4), Waiting-Blocking (5) are for internal use only. They temporarily shut off parts of the graph during interaction (e.g., manipulation). The understanding is that once the operation is done, the state will be reset appropriately, e.g. Waiting-Blocking will reset back to Blocking.    The Normal and Blocking cases apply to all nodes, while HasNoEffect is node specific; many nodes do not support this option. Plug-ins store state in the MPxNode::state attribute. Anyone can set it or check this attribute.  Additional details about each of these 3 states follow.     State Description   Normal The normal node state. This is the default.   HasNoEffect   The HasNoEffect option (a.k.a. pass-through), is used in cases where there is an operation on an input producing an output of the same data type. Nearly all deformers support this state, as do a few other nodes. As stated earlier, it is not supported by all nodes.   It’s typical to implement support for the HasNoEffect state in the node’s compute method and to perform appropriate operations. Plug-ins can also support HasNoEffect.   The usual implementation of this state is to copy the input directly to the matching output without applying the algorithm in the node. For deformers, applying this state leaves the input geometry undeformed on the output.     Blocking   This is implemented in the depend node base class and applies to all nodes. Blocking is applied during the evaluation phase to connections. An evaluation request to a blocked connection will return as failures, causing the destination plug to retain its current value. Dirty propagation is indirectly affected by this state since blocked connections are never cleaned.   When a node is set to Blocking the behavior is supposed to be the same as if all outgoing connections were broken. As long as nobody requests evaluation of the blocked node directly it won’t evaluate after that. Note that a blocked node will still respond to getAttr requests but a getAttr on a downstream node will not reevaluate the blocked node.   Setting the root transform of a hierarchy to Blocking won’t automatically influence child transforms in the hierarchy. To do this, you’d need to explicitly set all child nodes to the Blocking state.   For example, to set all child transforms to Blocking, you could use the following script.    import maya.cmds as cmds def blockTree(root): nodesToBlock = [] for node in {child:1 for child in cmds.listRelatives( root, path=True, allDescendents=True )}.keys(): nodesToBlock += cmds.listConnections(node, source=True, destination=True ) for node in {source:1 for source in nodesToBlock}.keys(): cmds.setAttr( '%s.nodeState' % node, 2 )    Applying this script would continue to draw objects but things would not be animated.     Default: kdnNormal

The understanding is that once the operation is done, the state will be reset appropriately, e.g. Waiting-Blocking will reset back to Blocking.    The Normal and Blocking cases apply to all nodes, while HasNoEffect is node specific; many nodes do not support this option. Plug-ins store state in the MPxNode::state attribute. Anyone can set it or check this attribute.  Additional details about each of these 3 states follow.     State Description   Normal The normal node state. This is the default.   HasNoEffect   The HasNoEffect option (a.k.a. pass-through), is used in cases where there is an operation on an input producing an output of the same data type. Nearly all deformers support this state, as do a few other nodes. As stated earlier, it is not supported by all nodes.   It’s typical to implement support for the HasNoEffect state in the node’s compute method and to perform appropriate operations. Plug-ins can also support HasNoEffect.   The usual implementation of this state is to copy the input directly to the matching output without applying the algorithm in the node. For deformers, applying this state leaves the input geometry undeformed on the output.     Blocking   This is implemented in the depend node base class and applies to all nodes. Blocking is applied during the evaluation phase to connections. An evaluation request to a blocked connection will return as failures, causing the destination plug to retain its current value. Dirty propagation is indirectly affected by this state since blocked connections are never cleaned.   When a node is set to Blocking the behavior is supposed to be the same as if all outgoing connections were broken. As long as nobody requests evaluation of the blocked node directly it won’t evaluate after that. Note that a blocked node will still respond to getAttr requests but a getAttr on a downstream node will not reevaluate the blocked node.   Setting the root transform of a hierarchy to Blocking won’t automatically influence child transforms in the hierarchy. To do this, you’d need to explicitly set all child nodes to the Blocking state.   For example, to set all child transforms to Blocking, you could use the following script.    import maya.cmds as cmds def blockTree(root): nodesToBlock = [] for node in {child:1 for child in cmds.listRelatives( root, path=True, allDescendents=True )}.keys(): nodesToBlock += cmds.listConnections(node, source=True, destination=True ) for node in {source:1 for source in nodesToBlock}.keys(): cmds.setAttr( '%s.nodeState' % node, 2 )    Applying this script would continue to draw objects but things would not be animated.

        nodeState: (create, edit, query) - Maya dependency nodes have 6 possible states. The Normal (0), HasNoEffect (1), and Blocking (2) states can be used to alter how the graph is evaluated.    The Waiting-Normal (3), Waiting-HasNoEffect (4), Waiting-Blocking (5) are for internal use only. They temporarily shut off parts of the graph during interaction (e.g., manipulation). The understanding is that once the operation is done, the state will be reset appropriately, e.g. Waiting-Blocking will reset back to Blocking.    The Normal and Blocking cases apply to all nodes, while HasNoEffect is node specific; many nodes do not support this option. Plug-ins store state in the MPxNode::state attribute. Anyone can set it or check this attribute.  Additional details about each of these 3 states follow.     State Description   Normal The normal node state. This is the default.   HasNoEffect   The HasNoEffect option (a.k.a. pass-through), is used in cases where there is an operation on an input producing an output of the same data type. Nearly all deformers support this state, as do a few other nodes. As stated earlier, it is not supported by all nodes.   It’s typical to implement support for the HasNoEffect state in the node’s compute method and to perform appropriate operations. Plug-ins can also support HasNoEffect.   The usual implementation of this state is to copy the input directly to the matching output without applying the algorithm in the node. For deformers, applying this state leaves the input geometry undeformed on the output.     Blocking   This is implemented in the depend node base class and applies to all nodes. Blocking is applied during the evaluation phase to connections. An evaluation request to a blocked connection will return as failures, causing the destination plug to retain its current value. Dirty propagation is indirectly affected by this state since blocked connections are never cleaned.   When a node is set to Blocking the behavior is supposed to be the same as if all outgoing connections were broken. As long as nobody requests evaluation of the blocked node directly it won’t evaluate after that. Note that a blocked node will still respond to getAttr requests but a getAttr on a downstream node will not reevaluate the blocked node.   Setting the root transform of a hierarchy to Blocking won’t automatically influence child transforms in the hierarchy. To do this, you’d need to explicitly set all child nodes to the Blocking state.   For example, to set all child transforms to Blocking, you could use the following script.    import maya.cmds as cmds def blockTree(root): nodesToBlock = [] for node in {child:1 for child in cmds.listRelatives( root, path=True, allDescendents=True )}.keys(): nodesToBlock += cmds.listConnections(node, source=True, destination=True ) for node in {source:1 for source in nodesToBlock}.keys(): cmds.setAttr( '%s.nodeState' % node, 2 )    Applying this script would continue to draw objects but things would not be animated.

        colorSet: (create, edit, query) - Specifies the name of the color set that this command needs to work on. This flag has to be specified for this command to do anything meaningful other than query the current color set.
        copy: (create, edit, query) - This flag when used will result in the copying of the color set corresponding to name specified with the colorSet flag to the colorSet corresponding to the name specified with the newcolorSet flag
        create: (create, edit, query) - This flag when used will result in the creation of an empty color set corresponding to the name specified with the colorSet flag. If a color set with that name already exists, then no new color set will be created.
        currentColorSet: (create, edit, query) - This flag when used will set the current color set that the object needs to work on, to be the color set corresponding to the name specified with the colorSet flag. This does require that a colorSet with the specified name exist. When queried, this returns the current color set.
        currentPerInstanceSet: (edit, query) - This is a query-only flag for use when the current color set is a per-instance color set family. This returns the member of the set family that corresponds to the currently select instance.
        delete: (create, edit, query) - This flag when used will result in the deletion of the color set corresponding to the name specified with the colorSet flag.
        newColorSet: (create, edit, query) - Specifies the name that the color set corresponding to the name specified with the colorSet flag, needs to be renamed to.
        perInstance: (create, edit, query) - This flag can be used in conjunction with the create flag to indicate whether or not the color set is per-instance. When you create a per-instance color set, the set will be applied as shared between all selected instances of the shape unless the unshared flag is used. The perInstance flag can be used in query mode with the currentColorSet or allColorSets flag to indicate that the set family names (i.e. not containing instance identifiers) will be returned by the query. 			In query mode, this flag can accept a value.
        rename: (create, edit, query) - This flag when used will result in the renaming of the color set corresponding to the name specified with the colorSet flag to the name specified using the newColorSet flag.

The understanding is that once the operation is done, the state will be reset appropriately, e.g. Waiting-Blocking will reset back to Blocking.    The Normal and Blocking cases apply to all nodes, while HasNoEffect is node specific; many nodes do not support this option. Plug-ins store state in the MPxNode::state attribute. Anyone can set it or check this attribute.  Additional details about each of these 3 states follow.     State Description   Normal The normal node state. This is the default.   HasNoEffect   The HasNoEffect option (a.k.a. pass-through), is used in cases where there is an operation on an input producing an output of the same data type. Nearly all deformers support this state, as do a few other nodes. As stated earlier, it is not supported by all nodes.   It’s typical to implement support for the HasNoEffect state in the node’s compute method and to perform appropriate operations. Plug-ins can also support HasNoEffect.   The usual implementation of this state is to copy the input directly to the matching output without applying the algorithm in the node. For deformers, applying this state leaves the input geometry undeformed on the output.     Blocking   This is implemented in the depend node base class and applies to all nodes. Blocking is applied during the evaluation phase to connections. An evaluation request to a blocked connection will return as failures, causing the destination plug to retain its current value. Dirty propagation is indirectly affected by this state since blocked connections are never cleaned.   When a node is set to Blocking the behavior is supposed to be the same as if all outgoing connections were broken. As long as nobody requests evaluation of the blocked node directly it won’t evaluate after that. Note that a blocked node will still respond to getAttr requests but a getAttr on a downstream node will not reevaluate the blocked node.   Setting the root transform of a hierarchy to Blocking won’t automatically influence child transforms in the hierarchy.

The Waiting-Normal (3), Waiting-HasNoEffect (4), Waiting-Blocking (5) are for internal use only. They temporarily shut off parts of the graph during interaction (e.g., manipulation). The understanding is that once the operation is done, the state will be reset appropriately, e.g. Waiting-Blocking will reset back to Blocking.    The Normal and Blocking cases apply to all nodes, while HasNoEffect is node specific; many nodes do not support this option. Plug-ins store state in the MPxNode::state attribute. Anyone can set it or check this attribute.  Additional details about each of these 3 states follow.     State Description   Normal The normal node state. This is the default.   HasNoEffect   The HasNoEffect option (a.k.a. pass-through), is used in cases where there is an operation on an input producing an output of the same data type. Nearly all deformers support this state, as do a few other nodes. As stated earlier, it is not supported by all nodes.   It’s typical to implement support for the HasNoEffect state in the node’s compute method and to perform appropriate operations. Plug-ins can also support HasNoEffect.   The usual implementation of this state is to copy the input directly to the matching output without applying the algorithm in the node. For deformers, applying this state leaves the input geometry undeformed on the output.     Blocking   This is implemented in the depend node base class and applies to all nodes. Blocking is applied during the evaluation phase to connections. An evaluation request to a blocked connection will return as failures, causing the destination plug to retain its current value. Dirty propagation is indirectly affected by this state since blocked connections are never cleaned.   When a node is set to Blocking the behavior is supposed to be the same as if all outgoing connections were broken. As long as nobody requests evaluation of the blocked node directly it won’t evaluate after that. Note that a blocked node will still respond to getAttr requests but a getAttr on a downstream node will not reevaluate the blocked node.

        name: (create) - Give a name to the resulting node.
        nodeState: (create, edit, query) - Maya dependency nodes have 6 possible states. The Normal (0), HasNoEffect (1), and Blocking (2) states can be used to alter how the graph is evaluated.    The Waiting-Normal (3), Waiting-HasNoEffect (4), Waiting-Blocking (5) are for internal use only. They temporarily shut off parts of the graph during interaction (e.g., manipulation). The understanding is that once the operation is done, the state will be reset appropriately, e.g. Waiting-Blocking will reset back to Blocking.    The Normal and Blocking cases apply to all nodes, while HasNoEffect is node specific; many nodes do not support this option. Plug-ins store state in the MPxNode::state attribute. Anyone can set it or check this attribute.  Additional details about each of these 3 states follow.     State Description   Normal The normal node state. This is the default.   HasNoEffect   The HasNoEffect option (a.k.a. pass-through), is used in cases where there is an operation on an input producing an output of the same data type. Nearly all deformers support this state, as do a few other nodes. As stated earlier, it is not supported by all nodes.   It’s typical to implement support for the HasNoEffect state in the node’s compute method and to perform appropriate operations. Plug-ins can also support HasNoEffect.   The usual implementation of this state is to copy the input directly to the matching output without applying the algorithm in the node. For deformers, applying this state leaves the input geometry undeformed on the output.     Blocking   This is implemented in the depend node base class and applies to all nodes. Blocking is applied during the evaluation phase to connections. An evaluation request to a blocked connection will return as failures, causing the destination plug to retain its current value. Dirty propagation is indirectly affected by this state since blocked connections are never cleaned.   When a node is set to Blocking the behavior is supposed to be the same as if all outgoing connections were broken. As long as nobody requests evaluation of the blocked node directly it won’t evaluate after that. Note that a blocked node will still respond to getAttr requests but a getAttr on a downstream node will not reevaluate the blocked node.   Setting the root transform of a hierarchy to Blocking won’t automatically influence child transforms in the hierarchy. To do this, you’d need to explicitly set all child nodes to the Blocking state.   For example, to set all child transforms to Blocking, you could use the following script.    import maya.cmds as cmds def blockTree(root): nodesToBlock = [] for node in {child:1 for child in cmds.listRelatives( root, path=True, allDescendents=True )}.keys(): nodesToBlock += cmds.listConnections(node, source=True, destination=True ) for node in {source:1 for source in nodesToBlock}.keys(): cmds.setAttr( '%s.nodeState' % node, 2 )    Applying this script would continue to draw objects but things would not be animated.

        nodeState: (create, edit, query) - Maya dependency nodes have 6 possible states. The Normal (0), HasNoEffect (1), and Blocking (2) states can be used to alter how the graph is evaluated.    The Waiting-Normal (3), Waiting-HasNoEffect (4), Waiting-Blocking (5) are for internal use only. They temporarily shut off parts of the graph during interaction (e.g., manipulation). The understanding is that once the operation is done, the state will be reset appropriately, e.g. Waiting-Blocking will reset back to Blocking.    The Normal and Blocking cases apply to all nodes, while HasNoEffect is node specific; many nodes do not support this option. Plug-ins store state in the MPxNode::state attribute. Anyone can set it or check this attribute.  Additional details about each of these 3 states follow.     State Description   Normal The normal node state. This is the default.   HasNoEffect   The HasNoEffect option (a.k.a. pass-through), is used in cases where there is an operation on an input producing an output of the same data type. Nearly all deformers support this state, as do a few other nodes. As stated earlier, it is not supported by all nodes.   It’s typical to implement support for the HasNoEffect state in the node’s compute method and to perform appropriate operations. Plug-ins can also support HasNoEffect.   The usual implementation of this state is to copy the input directly to the matching output without applying the algorithm in the node. For deformers, applying this state leaves the input geometry undeformed on the output.     Blocking   This is implemented in the depend node base class and applies to all nodes. Blocking is applied during the evaluation phase to connections. An evaluation request to a blocked connection will return as failures, causing the destination plug to retain its current value. Dirty propagation is indirectly affected by this state since blocked connections are never cleaned.   When a node is set to Blocking the behavior is supposed to be the same as if all outgoing connections were broken. As long as nobody requests evaluation of the blocked node directly it won’t evaluate after that. Note that a blocked node will still respond to getAttr requests but a getAttr on a downstream node will not reevaluate the blocked node.   Setting the root transform of a hierarchy to Blocking won’t automatically influence child transforms in the hierarchy. To do this, you’d need to explicitly set all child nodes to the Blocking state.   For example, to set all child transforms to Blocking, you could use the following script.    import maya.cmds as cmds def blockTree(root): nodesToBlock = [] for node in {child:1 for child in cmds.listRelatives( root, path=True, allDescendents=True )}.keys(): nodesToBlock += cmds.listConnections(node, source=True, destination=True ) for node in {source:1 for source in nodesToBlock}.keys(): cmds.setAttr( '%s.nodeState' % node, 2 )    Applying this script would continue to draw objects but things would not be animated.

    This command performs a render sampling of surface color and transparency for each selected vertex or face and stores the sampled data as either the color value, or uses the sampled data to displace the affected vertices or faces by a sampled data value. Transparency is not used for displacement, and displacement is performed along vertex normals. The sampled data value used can be pre-scaled by a user defined amount. Additionally, the normals chosen for sampling can be overridden using a "flat" shading option. This option basically means to always use the normals of the faces when computing sampling values. This may be a desired if the user wishes to override an edge smoothness factor. Basically with the "flat" shading option on, edges are always considered to be hard. Note that displacement sampling will result in the -sampleByFace option to be turned off, since a displacement of a vertex always affects the faces the vertex is connected to. Finally, it is possible to force the storage of shared colors per vertex, and / or force the usage of unshared UV values. The computation of the resulting color is as follows:

    Args:
        alphaBlend: (create, edit) - When specified, indicates the type of alpha blend to be applied. Options are: "none", "overwrite", "add", "subtract", "multiply", "divide", "average". This option only applies when colors are being set. The default if this argument is not specified is "overwrite". The "none" options to not overwrite the existing value.
        averageColor: (create, edit) - When used, will mean to force the storage of shared colors for vertex level sampling. By default vertex level sampling stores unshared colors.
        clampAlphaMax: (create, edit) - When used, will mean to clamp the storage of alpha to a maximum
        clampAlphaMin: (create, edit) - When used, will mean to clamp the storage of alpha to a minimum
        clampRGBMax: (create, edit) - When used, will mean to clamp the storage of RGB color to a maximum
        clampRGBMin: (create, edit) - When used, will mean to clamp the storage of RGB color to a minimum
        colorBlend: (create, edit) - When specified, indicates the type of color blend to be applied. Options are: "none", "overwrite", "add", "subtract", "multiply", "divide", "average". This option only applies when colors are being set. The default if this argument is not specified is "overwrite". The "none" options to not overwrite the existing value.
        colorDisplayOption: (create, edit) - Change the display options on the mesh to display the vertex colors.
        computeShadows: (create, edit) - When used, shadow maps will be computed, saved, and reused during the sampling process.
        displaceGeometry: (create, edit) - When used, geometry will be displaced along the normals at the sampling positions, as opposed to storing color values. The default is to store colors.
        flatShading: (create, edit) - When used, flat shaded sampling will be computed. The default is smooth shading.
        ignoreDoubleSided: (create, edit) - When specified, the double sided flag will be ignored for prelighting.
        lightingOnly: (create, edit) - When used, incoming illumination will be computed as opposed to surface color an tranparency
        reuseShadows: (create, edit) - When used, if shadow maps were previosly computed and saved, then they will be reused during the sampling process. The computeShadows option must be enabled for this option to apply.
        sampleByFace: (create, edit) - When used, sample will occur at a per face level versus a per vertex level, which is the default behaviour
        scaleFactor: (create, edit) - When used, will scale the sampled value by the specified amount. The default scale factor is 1.0. Negative values are acceptable for displacement, but not for color values.
        shareUV: (create, edit) - When used, UVs are shared at a vertex when sampled. By default UVs are forced to be unshared.

The usual implementation of this state is to copy the input directly to the matching output without applying the algorithm in the node. For deformers, applying this state leaves the input geometry undeformed on the output.     Blocking   This is implemented in the depend node base class and applies to all nodes. Blocking is applied during the evaluation phase to connections. An evaluation request to a blocked connection will return as failures, causing the destination plug to retain its current value. Dirty propagation is indirectly affected by this state since blocked connections are never cleaned.   When a node is set to Blocking the behavior is supposed to be the same as if all outgoing connections were broken. As long as nobody requests evaluation of the blocked node directly it won’t evaluate after that. Note that a blocked node will still respond to getAttr requests but a getAttr on a downstream node will not reevaluate the blocked node.   Setting the root transform of a hierarchy to Blocking won’t automatically influence child transforms in the hierarchy. To do this, you’d need to explicitly set all child nodes to the Blocking state.   For example, to set all child transforms to Blocking, you could use the following script.    import maya.cmds as cmds def blockTree(root): nodesToBlock = [] for node in {child:1 for child in cmds.listRelatives( root, path=True, allDescendents=True )}.keys(): nodesToBlock += cmds.listConnections(node, source=True, destination=True ) for node in {source:1 for source in nodesToBlock}.keys(): cmds.setAttr( '%s.nodeState' % node, 2 )    Applying this script would continue to draw objects but things would not be animated.

    Merge UVs of an object based on their distance. UVs are merge only if they belong to the same 3D vertex.

    Args:
        caching: (create, edit, query) - Toggle caching for all attributes so that no recomputation is needed
        constructionHistory: (create, query) - Turn the construction history on or off (where applicable). If construction history is on then the corresponding node will be inserted into the history chain for the mesh. If construction history is off then the operation will be performed directly on the object.  Note: If the object already has construction history then this flag is ignored and the node will always be inserted into the history chain.

The Waiting-Normal (3), Waiting-HasNoEffect (4), Waiting-Blocking (5) are for internal use only. They temporarily shut off parts of the graph during interaction (e.g., manipulation). The understanding is that once the operation is done, the state will be reset appropriately, e.g. Waiting-Blocking will reset back to Blocking.    The Normal and Blocking cases apply to all nodes, while HasNoEffect is node specific; many nodes do not support this option. Plug-ins store state in the MPxNode::state attribute. Anyone can set it or check this attribute.  Additional details about each of these 3 states follow.     State Description   Normal The normal node state. This is the default.   HasNoEffect   The HasNoEffect option (a.k.a. pass-through), is used in cases where there is an operation on an input producing an output of the same data type. Nearly all deformers support this state, as do a few other nodes. As stated earlier, it is not supported by all nodes.   It’s typical to implement support for the HasNoEffect state in the node’s compute method and to perform appropriate operations. Plug-ins can also support HasNoEffect.   The usual implementation of this state is to copy the input directly to the matching output without applying the algorithm in the node. For deformers, applying this state leaves the input geometry undeformed on the output.     Blocking   This is implemented in the depend node base class and applies to all nodes. Blocking is applied during the evaluation phase to connections. An evaluation request to a blocked connection will return as failures, causing the destination plug to retain its current value. Dirty propagation is indirectly affected by this state since blocked connections are never cleaned.   When a node is set to Blocking the behavior is supposed to be the same as if all outgoing connections were broken. As long as nobody requests evaluation of the blocked node directly it won’t evaluate after that. Note that a blocked node will still respond to getAttr requests but a getAttr on a downstream node will not reevaluate the blocked node.   Setting the root transform of a hierarchy to Blocking won’t automatically influence child transforms in the hierarchy. To do this, you’d need to explicitly set all child nodes to the Blocking state.   For example, to set all child transforms to Blocking, you could use the following script.    import maya.cmds as cmds def blockTree(root): nodesToBlock = [] for node in {child:1 for child in cmds.listRelatives( root, path=True, allDescendents=True )}.keys(): nodesToBlock += cmds.listConnections(node, source=True, destination=True ) for node in {source:1 for source in nodesToBlock}.keys(): cmds.setAttr( '%s.nodeState' % node, 2 )    Applying this script would continue to draw objects but things would not be animated.

        name: (create) - Give a name to the resulting node.
        nodeState: (create, edit, query) - Maya dependency nodes have 6 possible states. The Normal (0), HasNoEffect (1), and Blocking (2) states can be used to alter how the graph is evaluated.    The Waiting-Normal (3), Waiting-HasNoEffect (4), Waiting-Blocking (5) are for internal use only. They temporarily shut off parts of the graph during interaction (e.g., manipulation). The understanding is that once the operation is done, the state will be reset appropriately, e.g. Waiting-Blocking will reset back to Blocking.    The Normal and Blocking cases apply to all nodes, while HasNoEffect is node specific; many nodes do not support this option. Plug-ins store state in the MPxNode::state attribute. Anyone can set it or check this attribute.  Additional details about each of these 3 states follow.     State Description   Normal The normal node state. This is the default.   HasNoEffect   The HasNoEffect option (a.k.a. pass-through), is used in cases where there is an operation on an input producing an output of the same data type. Nearly all deformers support this state, as do a few other nodes. As stated earlier, it is not supported by all nodes.   It’s typical to implement support for the HasNoEffect state in the node’s compute method and to perform appropriate operations. Plug-ins can also support HasNoEffect.   The usual implementation of this state is to copy the input directly to the matching output without applying the algorithm in the node. For deformers, applying this state leaves the input geometry undeformed on the output.     Blocking   This is implemented in the depend node base class and applies to all nodes. Blocking is applied during the evaluation phase to connections. An evaluation request to a blocked connection will return as failures, causing the destination plug to retain its current value. Dirty propagation is indirectly affected by this state since blocked connections are never cleaned.   When a node is set to Blocking the behavior is supposed to be the same as if all outgoing connections were broken. As long as nobody requests evaluation of the blocked node directly it won’t evaluate after that. Note that a blocked node will still respond to getAttr requests but a getAttr on a downstream node will not reevaluate the blocked node.   Setting the root transform of a hierarchy to Blocking won’t automatically influence child transforms in the hierarchy. To do this, you’d need to explicitly set all child nodes to the Blocking state.   For example, to set all child transforms to Blocking, you could use the following script.    import maya.cmds as cmds def blockTree(root): nodesToBlock = [] for node in {child:1 for child in cmds.listRelatives( root, path=True, allDescendents=True )}.keys(): nodesToBlock += cmds.listConnections(node, source=True, destination=True ) for node in {source:1 for source in nodesToBlock}.keys(): cmds.setAttr( '%s.nodeState' % node, 2 )    Applying this script would continue to draw objects but things would not be animated.

The understanding is that once the operation is done, the state will be reset appropriately, e.g. Waiting-Blocking will reset back to Blocking.    The Normal and Blocking cases apply to all nodes, while HasNoEffect is node specific; many nodes do not support this option. Plug-ins store state in the MPxNode::state attribute. Anyone can set it or check this attribute.  Additional details about each of these 3 states follow.     State Description   Normal The normal node state. This is the default.   HasNoEffect   The HasNoEffect option (a.k.a. pass-through), is used in cases where there is an operation on an input producing an output of the same data type. Nearly all deformers support this state, as do a few other nodes. As stated earlier, it is not supported by all nodes.   It’s typical to implement support for the HasNoEffect state in the node’s compute method and to perform appropriate operations. Plug-ins can also support HasNoEffect.   The usual implementation of this state is to copy the input directly to the matching output without applying the algorithm in the node. For deformers, applying this state leaves the input geometry undeformed on the output.     Blocking   This is implemented in the depend node base class and applies to all nodes. Blocking is applied during the evaluation phase to connections. An evaluation request to a blocked connection will return as failures, causing the destination plug to retain its current value. Dirty propagation is indirectly affected by this state since blocked connections are never cleaned.   When a node is set to Blocking the behavior is supposed to be the same as if all outgoing connections were broken. As long as nobody requests evaluation of the blocked node directly it won’t evaluate after that. Note that a blocked node will still respond to getAttr requests but a getAttr on a downstream node will not reevaluate the blocked node.   Setting the root transform of a hierarchy to Blocking won’t automatically influence child transforms in the hierarchy.

        caching: (create, edit, query) - Toggle caching for all attributes so that no recomputation is needed
        constructionHistory: (create, query) - Turn the construction history on or off (where applicable). If construction history is on then the corresponding node will be inserted into the history chain for the mesh. If construction history is off then the operation will be performed directly on the object.  Note: If the object already has construction history then this flag is ignored and the node will always be inserted into the history chain.

        name: (create) - Give a name to the resulting node.
        nodeState: (create, edit, query) - Maya dependency nodes have 6 possible states. The Normal (0), HasNoEffect (1), and Blocking (2) states can be used to alter how the graph is evaluated.    The Waiting-Normal (3), Waiting-HasNoEffect (4), Waiting-Blocking (5) are for internal use only. They temporarily shut off parts of the graph during interaction (e.g., manipulation). The understanding is that once the operation is done, the state will be reset appropriately, e.g. Waiting-Blocking will reset back to Blocking.    The Normal and Blocking cases apply to all nodes, while HasNoEffect is node specific; many nodes do not support this option. Plug-ins store state in the MPxNode::state attribute. Anyone can set it or check this attribute.  Additional details about each of these 3 states follow.     State Description   Normal The normal node state. This is the default.   HasNoEffect   The HasNoEffect option (a.k.a. pass-through), is used in cases where there is an operation on an input producing an output of the same data type. Nearly all deformers support this state, as do a few other nodes. As stated earlier, it is not supported by all nodes.   It’s typical to implement support for the HasNoEffect state in the node’s compute method and to perform appropriate operations. Plug-ins can also support HasNoEffect.   The usual implementation of this state is to copy the input directly to the matching output without applying the algorithm in the node. For deformers, applying this state leaves the input geometry undeformed on the output.     Blocking   This is implemented in the depend node base class and applies to all nodes. Blocking is applied during the evaluation phase to connections. An evaluation request to a blocked connection will return as failures, causing the destination plug to retain its current value. Dirty propagation is indirectly affected by this state since blocked connections are never cleaned.   When a node is set to Blocking the behavior is supposed to be the same as if all outgoing connections were broken. As long as nobody requests evaluation of the blocked node directly it won’t evaluate after that. Note that a blocked node will still respond to getAttr requests but a getAttr on a downstream node will not reevaluate the blocked node.   Setting the root transform of a hierarchy to Blocking won’t automatically influence child transforms in the hierarchy. To do this, you’d need to explicitly set all child nodes to the Blocking state.   For example, to set all child transforms to Blocking, you could use the following script.    import maya.cmds as cmds def blockTree(root): nodesToBlock = [] for node in {child:1 for child in cmds.listRelatives( root, path=True, allDescendents=True )}.keys(): nodesToBlock += cmds.listConnections(node, source=True, destination=True ) for node in {source:1 for source in nodesToBlock}.keys(): cmds.setAttr( '%s.nodeState' % node, 2 )    Applying this script would continue to draw objects but things would not be animated.

The Normal and Blocking cases apply to all nodes, while HasNoEffect is node specific; many nodes do not support this option. Plug-ins store state in the MPxNode::state attribute. Anyone can set it or check this attribute.  Additional details about each of these 3 states follow.     State Description   Normal The normal node state. This is the default.   HasNoEffect   The HasNoEffect option (a.k.a. pass-through), is used in cases where there is an operation on an input producing an output of the same data type. Nearly all deformers support this state, as do a few other nodes. As stated earlier, it is not supported by all nodes.   It’s typical to implement support for the HasNoEffect state in the node’s compute method and to perform appropriate operations. Plug-ins can also support HasNoEffect.   The usual implementation of this state is to copy the input directly to the matching output without applying the algorithm in the node.

Each vertex in the output mesh has a shared color. This flag only applies when using the new algorithm. (-version 1) Q: When queried, this flag returns a string.
        vertexWeightCoefficient: (create, edit, query) - This flag specifies a constant value to multiply to each weight map value. A value of zero turns off the weight map.  This flag only applies when using the new algorithm. (-version 1) C: Default is 1. Q: When queried, this flag returns a float.
        weightCoefficient: (create, edit, query) - This flag only applies when using the old algorithm and is provided for backwards compatibility. The weight of each vertex is multiplied with this coefficient when the reduction is performed.  This value does not have to be edited, normally.  It gives finer control over the weighted reduction.

    Triangulates, then remeshes the given mesh through edge splitting and collapsing. Edges longer than the specified refinement threshold are split, and edges shorter than the reduction threshold are collapsed.

    Args:
        caching: (create, edit, query) - Toggle caching for all attributes so that no recomputation is needed
        collapseThreshold: (create, edit, query) - A percentage of the refineThreshold. Edges shorter than this percentage will be reduced to a single vertex.
        constructionHistory: (create, query) - Turn the construction history on or off (where applicable). If construction history is on then the corresponding node will be inserted into the history chain for the mesh. If construction history is off then the operation will be performed directly on the object.  Note: If the object already has construction history then this flag is ignored and the node will always be inserted into the history chain.
        interpolationType: (create, edit, query) - Algorithm used for interpolating new vertices
        maxEdgeLength: (create, edit, query) - Triangle edges longer than this value will be split into two edges.
        name: (create) - Give a name to the resulting node.
        nodeState: (create, edit, query) - Maya dependency nodes have 6 possible states. The Normal (0), HasNoEffect (1), and Blocking (2) states can be used to alter how the graph is evaluated.    The Waiting-Normal (3), Waiting-HasNoEffect (4), Waiting-Blocking (5) are for internal use only. They temporarily shut off parts of the graph during interaction (e.g., manipulation). The understanding is that once the operation is done, the state will be reset appropriately, e.g. Waiting-Blocking will reset back to Blocking.    The Normal and Blocking cases apply to all nodes, while HasNoEffect is node specific; many nodes do not support this option. Plug-ins store state in the MPxNode::state attribute. Anyone can set it or check this attribute.  Additional details about each of these 3 states follow.     State Description   Normal The normal node state. This is the default.   HasNoEffect   The HasNoEffect option (a.k.a. pass-through), is used in cases where there is an operation on an input producing an output of the same data type. Nearly all deformers support this state, as do a few other nodes. As stated earlier, it is not supported by all nodes.   It’s typical to implement support for the HasNoEffect state in the node’s compute method and to perform appropriate operations. Plug-ins can also support HasNoEffect.   The usual implementation of this state is to copy the input directly to the matching output without applying the algorithm in the node. For deformers, applying this state leaves the input geometry undeformed on the output.     Blocking   This is implemented in the depend node base class and applies to all nodes. Blocking is applied during the evaluation phase to connections. An evaluation request to a blocked connection will return as failures, causing the destination plug to retain its current value. Dirty propagation is indirectly affected by this state since blocked connections are never cleaned.   When a node is set to Blocking the behavior is supposed to be the same as if all outgoing connections were broken. As long as nobody requests evaluation of the blocked node directly it won’t evaluate after that. Note that a blocked node will still respond to getAttr requests but a getAttr on a downstream node will not reevaluate the blocked node.   Setting the root transform of a hierarchy to Blocking won’t automatically influence child transforms in the hierarchy. To do this, you’d need to explicitly set all child nodes to the Blocking state.   For example, to set all child transforms to Blocking, you could use the following script.    import maya.cmds as cmds def blockTree(root): nodesToBlock = [] for node in {child:1 for child in cmds.listRelatives( root, path=True, allDescendents=True )}.keys(): nodesToBlock += cmds.listConnections(node, source=True, destination=True ) for node in {source:1 for source in nodesToBlock}.keys(): cmds.setAttr( '%s.nodeState' % node, 2 )    Applying this script would continue to draw objects but things would not be animated.     Default: kdnNormal
        smoothStrength: (create, edit, query) - Amount of smoothing applied to the vertices after remeshing.
        tessellateBorders: (create, edit, query) - Specifies if the borders of the selected region are allowed to be remeshed.
        useRelativeValues: (create, edit, query) - Specifies if the refine threshold value is relative to the average edge length of the input mesh.

The usual implementation of this state is to copy the input directly to the matching output without applying the algorithm in the node. For deformers, applying this state leaves the input geometry undeformed on the output.     Blocking   This is implemented in the depend node base class and applies to all nodes. Blocking is applied during the evaluation phase to connections. An evaluation request to a blocked connection will return as failures, causing the destination plug to retain its current value. Dirty propagation is indirectly affected by this state since blocked connections are never cleaned.   When a node is set to Blocking the behavior is supposed to be the same as if all outgoing connections were broken. As long as nobody requests evaluation of the blocked node directly it won’t evaluate after that. Note that a blocked node will still respond to getAttr requests but a getAttr on a downstream node will not reevaluate the blocked node.   Setting the root transform of a hierarchy to Blocking won’t automatically influence child transforms in the hierarchy. To do this, you’d need to explicitly set all child nodes to the Blocking state.   For example, to set all child transforms to Blocking, you could use the following script.    import maya.cmds as cmds def blockTree(root): nodesToBlock = [] for node in {child:1 for child in cmds.listRelatives( root, path=True, allDescendents=True )}.keys(): nodesToBlock += cmds.listConnections(node, source=True, destination=True ) for node in {source:1 for source in nodesToBlock}.keys(): cmds.setAttr( '%s.nodeState' % node, 2 )    Applying this script would continue to draw objects but things would not be animated.

        rotate: (create) - Proportionally rotate each object by the given angles. The rotation values are scaled by the percentage specified by that object's corresponding "-percent" flag.

The Waiting-Normal (3), Waiting-HasNoEffect (4), Waiting-Blocking (5) are for internal use only. They temporarily shut off parts of the graph during interaction (e.g., manipulation). The understanding is that once the operation is done, the state will be reset appropriately, e.g. Waiting-Blocking will reset back to Blocking.    The Normal and Blocking cases apply to all nodes, while HasNoEffect is node specific; many nodes do not support this option. Plug-ins store state in the MPxNode::state attribute. Anyone can set it or check this attribute.  Additional details about each of these 3 states follow.     State Description   Normal The normal node state. This is the default.   HasNoEffect   The HasNoEffect option (a.k.a. pass-through), is used in cases where there is an operation on an input producing an output of the same data type. Nearly all deformers support this state, as do a few other nodes. As stated earlier, it is not supported by all nodes.   It’s typical to implement support for the HasNoEffect state in the node’s compute method and to perform appropriate operations. Plug-ins can also support HasNoEffect.   The usual implementation of this state is to copy the input directly to the matching output without applying the algorithm in the node. For deformers, applying this state leaves the input geometry undeformed on the output.     Blocking   This is implemented in the depend node base class and applies to all nodes. Blocking is applied during the evaluation phase to connections. An evaluation request to a blocked connection will return as failures, causing the destination plug to retain its current value. Dirty propagation is indirectly affected by this state since blocked connections are never cleaned.   When a node is set to Blocking the behavior is supposed to be the same as if all outgoing connections were broken. As long as nobody requests evaluation of the blocked node directly it won’t evaluate after that. Note that a blocked node will still respond to getAttr requests but a getAttr on a downstream node will not reevaluate the blocked node.   Setting the root transform of a hierarchy to Blocking won’t automatically influence child transforms in the hierarchy. To do this, you’d need to explicitly set all child nodes to the Blocking state.   For example, to set all child transforms to Blocking, you could use the following script.    import maya.cmds as cmds def blockTree(root): nodesToBlock = [] for node in {child:1 for child in cmds.listRelatives( root, path=True, allDescendents=True )}.keys(): nodesToBlock += cmds.listConnections(node, source=True, destination=True ) for node in {source:1 for source in nodesToBlock}.keys(): cmds.setAttr( '%s.nodeState' % node, 2 )    Applying this script would continue to draw objects but things would not be animated.

Nearly all deformers support this state, as do a few other nodes. As stated earlier, it is not supported by all nodes.   It’s typical to implement support for the HasNoEffect state in the node’s compute method and to perform appropriate operations. Plug-ins can also support HasNoEffect.   The usual implementation of this state is to copy the input directly to the matching output without applying the algorithm in the node. For deformers, applying this state leaves the input geometry undeformed on the output.     Blocking   This is implemented in the depend node base class and applies to all nodes. Blocking is applied during the evaluation phase to connections. An evaluation request to a blocked connection will return as failures, causing the destination plug to retain its current value. Dirty propagation is indirectly affected by this state since blocked connections are never cleaned.   When a node is set to Blocking the behavior is supposed to be the same as if all outgoing connections were broken. As long as nobody requests evaluation of the blocked node directly it won’t evaluate after that. Note that a blocked node will still respond to getAttr requests but a getAttr on a downstream node will not reevaluate the blocked node.   Setting the root transform of a hierarchy to Blocking won’t automatically influence child transforms in the hierarchy. To do this, you’d need to explicitly set all child nodes to the Blocking state.   For example, to set all child transforms to Blocking, you could use the following script.    import maya.cmds as cmds def blockTree(root): nodesToBlock = [] for node in {child:1 for child in cmds.listRelatives( root, path=True, allDescendents=True )}.keys(): nodesToBlock += cmds.listConnections(node, source=True, destination=True ) for node in {source:1 for source in nodesToBlock}.keys(): cmds.setAttr( '%s.nodeState' % node, 2 )    Applying this script would continue to draw objects but things would not be animated.

The same number of "a" values as "b" values must be specified. If no sides are specified with the "side" flag (or sidea/sideb flags), then the edges are assumed to be in pairs. See also examples below. For example, two faces of a cube meet at an edge pair. Suppose one of the faces is then split in two pieces at the middle of the edge, so that there is one face on side "A", and two pieces on side "B".

        off: (create, query) - In create mode, turn off the member which is specified by the flags "stream", "member" and "dataType".
        range: (create, query) - Specify the range of data to use. The value which is out of the range will be clamped to the min/max value.

The Normal and Blocking cases apply to all nodes, while HasNoEffect is node specific; many nodes do not support this option. Plug-ins store state in the MPxNode::state attribute. Anyone can set it or check this attribute.  Additional details about each of these 3 states follow.     State Description   Normal The normal node state. This is the default.   HasNoEffect   The HasNoEffect option (a.k.a. pass-through), is used in cases where there is an operation on an input producing an output of the same data type. Nearly all deformers support this state, as do a few other nodes. As stated earlier, it is not supported by all nodes.   It’s typical to implement support for the HasNoEffect state in the node’s compute method and to perform appropriate operations. Plug-ins can also support HasNoEffect.   The usual implementation of this state is to copy the input directly to the matching output without applying the algorithm in the node. For deformers, applying this state leaves the input geometry undeformed on the output.     Blocking   This is implemented in the depend node base class and applies to all nodes. Blocking is applied during the evaluation phase to connections. An evaluation request to a blocked connection will return as failures, causing the destination plug to retain its current value. Dirty propagation is indirectly affected by this state since blocked connections are never cleaned.   When a node is set to Blocking the behavior is supposed to be the same as if all outgoing connections were broken. As long as nobody requests evaluation of the blocked node directly it won’t evaluate after that. Note that a blocked node will still respond to getAttr requests but a getAttr on a downstream node will not reevaluate the blocked node.   Setting the root transform of a hierarchy to Blocking won’t automatically influence child transforms in the hierarchy. To do this, you’d need to explicitly set all child nodes to the Blocking state.   For example, to set all child transforms to Blocking, you could use the following script.    import maya.cmds as cmds def blockTree(root): nodesToBlock = [] for node in {child:1 for child in cmds.listRelatives( root, path=True, allDescendents=True )}.keys(): nodesToBlock += cmds.listConnections(node, source=True, destination=True ) for node in {source:1 for source in nodesToBlock}.keys(): cmds.setAttr( '%s.nodeState' % node, 2 )    Applying this script would continue to draw objects but things would not be animated.

        nodeState: (create, edit, query) - Maya dependency nodes have 6 possible states. The Normal (0), HasNoEffect (1), and Blocking (2) states can be used to alter how the graph is evaluated.    The Waiting-Normal (3), Waiting-HasNoEffect (4), Waiting-Blocking (5) are for internal use only. They temporarily shut off parts of the graph during interaction (e.g., manipulation). The understanding is that once the operation is done, the state will be reset appropriately, e.g. Waiting-Blocking will reset back to Blocking.    The Normal and Blocking cases apply to all nodes, while HasNoEffect is node specific; many nodes do not support this option. Plug-ins store state in the MPxNode::state attribute. Anyone can set it or check this attribute.  Additional details about each of these 3 states follow.     State Description   Normal The normal node state. This is the default.   HasNoEffect   The HasNoEffect option (a.k.a. pass-through), is used in cases where there is an operation on an input producing an output of the same data type. Nearly all deformers support this state, as do a few other nodes. As stated earlier, it is not supported by all nodes.   It’s typical to implement support for the HasNoEffect state in the node’s compute method and to perform appropriate operations. Plug-ins can also support HasNoEffect.   The usual implementation of this state is to copy the input directly to the matching output without applying the algorithm in the node. For deformers, applying this state leaves the input geometry undeformed on the output.     Blocking   This is implemented in the depend node base class and applies to all nodes. Blocking is applied during the evaluation phase to connections. An evaluation request to a blocked connection will return as failures, causing the destination plug to retain its current value. Dirty propagation is indirectly affected by this state since blocked connections are never cleaned.   When a node is set to Blocking the behavior is supposed to be the same as if all outgoing connections were broken. As long as nobody requests evaluation of the blocked node directly it won’t evaluate after that. Note that a blocked node will still respond to getAttr requests but a getAttr on a downstream node will not reevaluate the blocked node.   Setting the root transform of a hierarchy to Blocking won’t automatically influence child transforms in the hierarchy. To do this, you’d need to explicitly set all child nodes to the Blocking state.   For example, to set all child transforms to Blocking, you could use the following script.    import maya.cmds as cmds def blockTree(root): nodesToBlock = [] for node in {child:1 for child in cmds.listRelatives( root, path=True, allDescendents=True )}.keys(): nodesToBlock += cmds.listConnections(node, source=True, destination=True ) for node in {source:1 for source in nodesToBlock}.keys(): cmds.setAttr( '%s.nodeState' % node, 2 )    Applying this script would continue to draw objects but things would not be animated.

    TsubProjCmdBase is a base class for the command to create a mapping on the selected subdivision faces. Projects a map onto an object, using an orthogonal projection. The piece of the map defined from isu, isv, icx, icy area, is placed at pcx, pcy, pcz location.

    Args:
        caching: (create, edit, query) - Toggle caching for all attributes so that no recomputation is needed
        nodeState: (create, edit, query) - Maya dependency nodes have 6 possible states. The Normal (0), HasNoEffect (1), and Blocking (2) states can be used to alter how the graph is evaluated.    The Waiting-Normal (3), Waiting-HasNoEffect (4), Waiting-Blocking (5) are for internal use only. They temporarily shut off parts of the graph during interaction (e.g., manipulation). The understanding is that once the operation is done, the state will be reset appropriately, e.g. Waiting-Blocking will reset back to Blocking.    The Normal and Blocking cases apply to all nodes, while HasNoEffect is node specific; many nodes do not support this option. Plug-ins store state in the MPxNode::state attribute. Anyone can set it or check this attribute.  Additional details about each of these 3 states follow.     State Description   Normal The normal node state. This is the default.   HasNoEffect   The HasNoEffect option (a.k.a. pass-through), is used in cases where there is an operation on an input producing an output of the same data type. Nearly all deformers support this state, as do a few other nodes. As stated earlier, it is not supported by all nodes.   It’s typical to implement support for the HasNoEffect state in the node’s compute method and to perform appropriate operations. Plug-ins can also support HasNoEffect.   The usual implementation of this state is to copy the input directly to the matching output without applying the algorithm in the node. For deformers, applying this state leaves the input geometry undeformed on the output.     Blocking   This is implemented in the depend node base class and applies to all nodes. Blocking is applied during the evaluation phase to connections. An evaluation request to a blocked connection will return as failures, causing the destination plug to retain its current value. Dirty propagation is indirectly affected by this state since blocked connections are never cleaned.   When a node is set to Blocking the behavior is supposed to be the same as if all outgoing connections were broken. As long as nobody requests evaluation of the blocked node directly it won’t evaluate after that. Note that a blocked node will still respond to getAttr requests but a getAttr on a downstream node will not reevaluate the blocked node.   Setting the root transform of a hierarchy to Blocking won’t automatically influence child transforms in the hierarchy. To do this, you’d need to explicitly set all child nodes to the Blocking state.   For example, to set all child transforms to Blocking, you could use the following script.    import maya.cmds as cmds def blockTree(root): nodesToBlock = [] for node in {child:1 for child in cmds.listRelatives( root, path=True, allDescendents=True )}.keys(): nodesToBlock += cmds.listConnections(node, source=True, destination=True ) for node in {source:1 for source in nodesToBlock}.keys(): cmds.setAttr( '%s.nodeState' % node, 2 )    Applying this script would continue to draw objects but things would not be animated.

    Samples the attributes of a source surface (first argument) and transfers them onto a target surface (second argument).

    Args:
        after: (create, edit) - If the default behavior for insertion/appending into/onto the existing chain is not the desired behavior then this flag can be used to force the command to place the deformer node after the selected node in the chain even if a new geometry shape has to be created in order to do so. Works in create mode (and edit mode if the deformer has no geometry added yet).
        afterReference: (create, edit) - The -afterReference flag is used to specify deformer ordering in a hybrid way that choses between -before and -after automatically. If the geometry being deformed is referenced then the -after mode is used when adding the new deformer, otherwise the -before mode is used. The net effect when using -afterReference to build deformer chains is that internal shape nodes in the deformer chain will only appear at reference file boundaries, leading to lightweight deformer networks that may be more amicable to reference swapping.
        before: (create, edit) - If the default behavior for insertion/appending into/onto the existing chain is not the desired behavior then this flag can be used to force the command to place the deformer node before the selected node in the chain even if a new geometry shape has to be created in order to do so. Works in create mode (and edit mode if the deformer has no geometry added yet).
        colorBorders: (create, edit) - Controls whether color borders are preserved when transferring color data. If this is non-zero, any color borders will be mapped onto the nearest edge on the target geometry. 0 means any color borders will be smoothly blended onto the vertices of the target geometry.
        components: (query) - Returns the components used by the deformer
        deformerTools: (query) - Returns the name of the deformer tool objects (if any) as string string ...
        exclusive: (create, query) - Puts the deformation set in a deform partition.
        flipUVs: (create, edit) - Controls how sampled UV data is flipped before being transferred to the target. 0 means no flipping; 1 means UV data is flipped in the U direction; 2 means UV data is flipped in the V direction; and 3 means it is flipped in both directions. In conjunction with mirroring, this allows the creation of symmetric UV mappings (e.g. the left hand side of the character on one side of the UV map, the right hand side on the other).
        frontOfChain: (create, edit) - This command is used to specify that the new deformer node should be placed ahead (upstream) of existing deformer and skin nodes in the shape's history (but not ahead of existing tweak nodes). The input to the deformer will be the upstream shape rather than the visible downstream shape, so the behavior of this flag is the most intuitive if the downstream deformers are in their reset (hasNoEffect) position when the new deformer is added. Works in create mode (and edit mode if the deformer has no geometry added yet).
        geometry: (edit, multiuse, query) - The specified object will be added to the list of objects being deformed by this deformer object, unless the -rm flag is also specified. When queried, this flag returns string string string ...
        geometryIndices: (query) - Complements the -geometry flag in query mode. Returns the multi index of each geometry.
        ignoreSelected: (create) - Tells the command to not deform objects on the current selection list
        includeHiddenSelections: (create) - Apply the deformer to any visible and hidden objects in the selection list. Default is false.
        matchChoice: (create, edit) - When using topological component matching, selects between possible matches. If the meshes involved in the transfer operation have symmetries in their topologies, there may be more than one possible topological match. Maya scores the possible matches (by comparing the shapes of the meshes) and assigns them an index, starting at zero. Match zero, the default, is considered the best, but in the event that Maya chooses the wrong one, changing this value will allow the user to explore the other matches.
        name: (create) - Used to specify the name of the node being created.
        parallel: (create, edit) - Inserts the new deformer in a parallel chain to any existing deformers in the history of the object. A blendShape is inserted to blend the parallel results together. Works in create mode (and edit mode if the deformer has no geometry added yet).
        prune: (edit) - Removes any points not being deformed by the deformer in its current configuration from the deformer set.
        remove: (edit, multiuse) - Specifies that objects listed after the -g flag should be removed from this deformer.
        sampleSpace: (create, edit) - Selects which space the attribute transfer is performed in. 0 is world space, 1 is model space, 4 is component-based, 5 is topology-based. The default is world space.
        searchMethod: (create, edit) - Specifies which search method to use when correlating points. 0 is closest along normal, 3 is closest to point. The default is closest to point.
        searchScaleX: (create, edit) - Specifies an optional scale that should be applied to the x-axis of the target model before transferring data. A value of 1.0 (the default) means no scaling; a value of -1.0 would indicate mirroring along the x-axis.
        searchScaleY: (create, edit) - Specifies an optional scale that should be applied to the y-axis of the target model before transferring data. A value of 1.0 (the default) means no scaling; a value of -1.0 would indicate mirroring along the y-axis.
        searchScaleZ: (create, edit) - Specifies an optional scale that should be applied to the z-axis of the target model before transferring data. A value of 1.0 (the default) means no scaling; a value of -1.0 would indicate mirroring along the z-axis.
        selectedComponents: (query) - Returns the components used by the deformer that are currently selected. This intersects the current selection with the components affected by the deformer.
        sourceColorSet: (create) - Specifies the name of a single color set on the source surface(s) that should be transferred to the target. This value is only used when the operation is configured to transfer a single color set (see the transferColors flag).
        sourceUvSet: (create) - Specifies the name of a single UV set on the source surface(s) that should be transferred to the target. This value is only used when the operation is configured to transfer a single UV set (see the transferUVs flag).
        sourceUvSpace: (create) - Specifies the name of the UV set on the source surface(s) that should be used as the transfer space. This value is only used when the operation is configured to transfer attributes in UV space.
        split: (create, edit) - Branches off a new chain in the dependency graph instead of inserting/appending the deformer into/onto an existing chain. Works in create mode (and edit mode if the deformer has no geometry added yet).
        targetColorSet: (create) - Specifies the name of a single color set on the target surface that should be receive the sampled color data. This value is only used when the operation is configured to transfer a single color set (see the transferColors flag).
        targetUvSet: (create) - Specifies the name of a single UV set on the target surface that should be receive the sampled UV data. This value is only used when the operation is configured to transfer a single UV set (see the transferUVs flag).
        targetUvSpace: (create) - Specifies the name of the UV set on the target surface( that should be used as the transfer space. This value is only used when the operation is configured to transfer attributes in UV space.
        transferColors: (create, edit) - Controls color set transfer. 0 means no color sets are transferred, 1 means that a single color set (specified by sourceColorSet and targetColorSet) is transferred, and 2 means that all color sets are transferred.
        transferNormals: (create, edit) - A non-zero value indicates vertex normals should be sampled and written into user normals on the target surface.
        transferPositions: (create, edit) - A non-zero value indicates vertex position should be sampled, causing the target surface to "wrap" to the source surface(s).
        transferUVs: (create, edit) - Controls UV set transfer. 0 means no UV sets are transferred, 1 means that a single UV set (specified by sourceUVSet and targetUVSet) is transferred, and 2 means that all UV sets are transferred.
        useComponentTags: (create) - When this flag is specified a setup using componentTags will be created. This means no groupId, groupParts, tweak or objectSet nodes will be created and connected to the new deformer.

        locatorU: (create, edit, multiuse, query) - u parameter value to position a locator on the surface. Default: 0.5
        locatorV: (create, edit, multiuse, query) - v parameter value to position a locator on the surface. Default: 0.5
        nodeState: (create, edit, query) - Maya dependency nodes have 6 possible states. The Normal (0), HasNoEffect (1), and Blocking (2) states can be used to alter how the graph is evaluated.    The Waiting-Normal (3), Waiting-HasNoEffect (4), Waiting-Blocking (5) are for internal use only. They temporarily shut off parts of the graph during interaction (e.g., manipulation). The understanding is that once the operation is done, the state will be reset appropriately, e.g. Waiting-Blocking will reset back to Blocking.    The Normal and Blocking cases apply to all nodes, while HasNoEffect is node specific; many nodes do not support this option. Plug-ins store state in the MPxNode::state attribute. Anyone can set it or check this attribute.  Additional details about each of these 3 states follow.     State Description   Normal The normal node state. This is the default.   HasNoEffect   The HasNoEffect option (a.k.a. pass-through), is used in cases where there is an operation on an input producing an output of the same data type. Nearly all deformers support this state, as do a few other nodes. As stated earlier, it is not supported by all nodes.   It’s typical to implement support for the HasNoEffect state in the node’s compute method and to perform appropriate operations. Plug-ins can also support HasNoEffect.   The usual implementation of this state is to copy the input directly to the matching output without applying the algorithm in the node. For deformers, applying this state leaves the input geometry undeformed on the output.     Blocking   This is implemented in the depend node base class and applies to all nodes. Blocking is applied during the evaluation phase to connections. An evaluation request to a blocked connection will return as failures, causing the destination plug to retain its current value. Dirty propagation is indirectly affected by this state since blocked connections are never cleaned.   When a node is set to Blocking the behavior is supposed to be the same as if all outgoing connections were broken. As long as nobody requests evaluation of the blocked node directly it won’t evaluate after that. Note that a blocked node will still respond to getAttr requests but a getAttr on a downstream node will not reevaluate the blocked node.   Setting the root transform of a hierarchy to Blocking won’t automatically influence child transforms in the hierarchy. To do this, you’d need to explicitly set all child nodes to the Blocking state.   For example, to set all child transforms to Blocking, you could use the following script.    import maya.cmds as cmds def blockTree(root): nodesToBlock = [] for node in {child:1 for child in cmds.listRelatives( root, path=True, allDescendents=True )}.keys(): nodesToBlock += cmds.listConnections(node, source=True, destination=True ) for node in {source:1 for source in nodesToBlock}.keys(): cmds.setAttr( '%s.nodeState' % node, 2 )    Applying this script would continue to draw objects but things would not be animated.

        globalBlend: (create) - This allows the user to blend between a local optimization method (globalBlend = 0.0) and a global optimization method (globalBlend = 1.0). The local optimization method looks at the ratio between the triangles on the object and the triangles in UV space.  It has a side affect that it can sometimes introduce tapering problems.  The global optimization is much slower, but takes into consideration the entire object when optimizing uv placement.
        globalMethodBlend: (create) - The global optimization method uses two functions to compute a minimization.  The first function controls edge stretch by using edges lengths between xyz and uv.  The second function penalizes the first function by preventing configurations where triangles would overlap.  For every surface there is a mix between these two functions that will give the appropriate response. Values closer to 1.0 give more weight to the edge length function. Values closer to 0.0 give more weight to surface area.  The default value of '0.5' is a even mix between these two values.

There are a number of different methods characterized by the way the UV edges are weighted in the spring system. These weightings are determined by STRING. Valid values for STRING are: uniform - every edge is weighted the same. This is the fastest method. inverse_length - every edge weight is inversely proportional to it's world space length. inverse_sqrt_length - every edge weight is inversely proportional the the square root of it's world space length. harmonic - this weighting can yield near optimal results in matching the UV's with the geometry, but can also take a long time.
