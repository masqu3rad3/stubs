        aimVector: (create, edit, query) - Set the aim vector.  This is the vector in local coordinates that points at the target.  If not given at creation time, the default value of (1.0, 0.0, 0.0) is used.
        layer: (create, edit) - Specify the name of the animation layer where the constraint should be added.
        maintainOffset: (create) - The offset necessary to preserve the constrained object's initial rotation will be calculated and used as the offset.
        name: (create, edit, query) - Sets the name of the constraint node to the specified name.  Default name is constrainedObjectName_constraintType
        offset: (create, edit, query) - Sets or queries the value of the offset. Default is 0,0,0.
        remove: (edit) - removes the listed target(s) from the constraint.
        skip: (create, edit, multiuse) - Specify the axis to be skipped. Valid values are "x", "y", "z" and "none". During creation, "none" is the default.
        targetList: (query) - Return the list of target objects.
        upVector: (create, edit, query) - Set local up vector.  This is the vector in local coordinates that aligns with the world up vector.  If not given at creation time, the default value of (0.0, 1.0, 0.0) is used.

If the value is "vector", the upVector is aligned with worldUpVector as closely as possible and worldUpMatrix is ignored. Finally, if the value is "none" no twist calculation is performed by the constraint, with the resulting "upVector" orientation based previous orientation of the constrained object, and the "great circle" rotation needed to align the aim vector with its constraint.

    Given a rigged character, whose mesh shape is determined by a set of deformers, bakeDeformer calculates linear blend skin weights most closely approximating observed deformations. To do this, a test set of examples is generated by moving the rig through a range of motion. Results mesh and pose pairs are then used to solve a constrained optimization, solving for skinning weights. bakeDeformer automatically binds and applies resulting weights to the destination geometry. If the source and destination mesh/skeleton are identical, the command will replace the original deformations with a skinCluster and computed weights. See the below examples for sample usage.

    Args:
        colorizeSkeleton: (create) - The new skin cluster created will have its skeleton colorized. Must be used with the -srcSkeletonName and -dstSkeletonName flags.
        customRangeOfMotion: (create) - When this flag is specified with the frames for the range of motion to be used, the tool will step through each frame as a separate pose. Otherwise the tool will use the existing range of motion in the tool that rotates each influence 45 degrees.      Usage examples:       -rom "10:20" means all frames in the range from 10 to 20, inclusive, in the current time unit.   Omitting one end of a range means using either end of the animation range (or both), as in the following examples:   -rom "10:" means all frames from time 10 (in the current time unit) onwards to the maximum time in the animation range (on the timeline).   -rom ":10" means all frames from the minimum time on the animation range (on the timeline) up to (and including) time 10 (in the current time unit).   -rom ":" is a short form to specify all frames, from minimum to maximum time on the current animation range.    When using this flag, some of the joints in the specified range of motion may not have changed sufficiently. To improve bakeDeformer results or avoid algorithm errors, the command will return a list of influences that do not move enough in the specified range of motion. To detect these joints, the local transformation of each joint is compared between subsequent frames. We consider that a joint has sufficiently changed if any of the below criteria are met:      There is a rotation of at least 5 degrees, as determined by the shortest rotation between transforms. There is a translation of 1% or greater of the size of the largest bounding box containing all joints for each frame. There is a scaling change of at least 1%. This percentage represents the smallest scaling value over the largest scaling value (in absolute value).       If a joint has not met any of the criteria, it will be added to the warning of joints that have not moved enough.        The custom range of motion should be considered experimental.
        dstMeshName: (create) - The destination mesh name.
        dstSkeletonName: (create) - The destination skeleton name.
        hierarchy: (create) - All children of the passed joints that are used in the influences flag are used.
        influences: (create) - A list of joints that are used as the influences to determine new weights.
        maxInfluences: (create) - The maximum number of influences per vertex.
        pruneWeights: (create) - On the newly created skin cluster, set any weight below the given the value to zero (post-processing). This will call the skinPercent command as follows: "skinPercent -pruneWeights [value] [skinClusterName] [dstMeshName]" where [value] is the value passed into this flag, [skinClusterName] is the name of the new skinCluster node created after running this tool, and [dstMeshName] is the mesh provided in the -dstMeshName flag.

        controlPoints: (create) - This flag explicitly specifies whether or not to include the control points of a shape (see "-s" flag) in the list of attributes. Default: false.  (Not valid for "pasteKey" cmd.) In query mode, this flag needs a value.
        destinationLayer: (create) - This flag can be used to specify an existing layer where the baked results should be stored. Use this flag with caution. If the destination layer already has animation on it that contributes to the final result, it will be replaced by the output of the bake. As a result, it is possible that the combined animation visible in the scene is different before / after the baking process.
        disableImplicitControl: (create) - Whether to disable implicit control after the anim curves are obtained as the result of this command. An implicit control to an attribute is some function that affects the attribute without using an explicit dependency graph connection. The control of IK, via ik handles, is an example.
        float: (create, multiuse) - value uniquely representing a non-time-based key (or key range) on a time-based animCurve. Valid floatRange include single values (-f 10) or a string with a lower and upper bound, separated by a colon (-f "10:20")       In query mode, this flag needs a value.
        hierarchy: (create) - Hierarchy expansion options.  Valid values are "above," "below," "both," and "none." (Not valid for "pasteKey" cmd.) In query mode, this flag needs a value.
        includeUpperBound: (create) - When the -t/time or -f/float flags represent a range of keys, this flag determines whether the keys at the upper bound of the range are included in the keyset. Default value: true. This flag is only valid when the argument to the -t/time flag is a time range with a lower and upper bound. Note: when used with the "pasteKey" command, this flag refers only to the time range of the target curve that is replaced, when using options such as "replace," "fitReplace," or "scaleReplace." This flag has no effect on the curve pasted from the clipboard.
        index: (create, multiuse) - index of a key on an animCurve       In query mode, this flag needs a value.
        minimizeRotation: (create) - Specify whether to minimize the local Euler component from key to key during baking of rotation channels.
        oversamplingRate: (create) - Amount of samples per sampleBy period. Default is 1.
        preserveOutsideKeys: (create) - Whether to preserve keys that are outside the bake range when there are directly connected animation curves or a pairBlend node which has an animation curve as its direct input. The default (false) is to remove frames outside the bake range. If the channel that you are baking is not controlled by a single animation curve, then a new animation curve will be created with keys only in the bake range. In the case of pairBlend-driven channels, setting pok to true will retain both the pairBlend and its input animCurve. The blended values will be baked onto the animCurve and the weight of the pairBlend weight will be keyed to the animCurve during the baked range.
        removeBakedAnimFromLayer: (create) - If true, all baked animation will be removed from the layer. Otherwise all layer associated with the baked animation will be muted.
        removeBakedAttributeFromLayer: (create) - If true, all baked attribute will be removed from the layer. Otherwise all layer associated with the baked attribute will be muted.
        resolveWithoutLayer: (create, multiuse) - This flag can be used to specify a list of layers to be merged together during the bake process. This is a multi-use flag. Its name refers to the fact that when solving for the value to key, it determines the proper value to key on the destination layer to achieve the same result as the merged layers.
        sampleBy: (create) - Amount to sample by. Default is 1.0 in current timeUnit.
        shape: (create) - Consider attributes of shapes below transforms as well, except "controlPoints".  Default: true.  (Not valid for "pasteKey" cmd.) In query mode, this flag needs a value.
        simulation: (create) - Using this flag instructs the command to preform a simulation instead of just evaluating each attribute separately over the range of time. The simulation flag is required to bake animation that depends on the whole scene being evaluated at each time step such as dynamics. The default is false.
        smart: (create) - Specify whether to enable smart bake and the optional smart bake tolerance.
        sparseAnimCurveBake: (create) - When this is true and anim curves are being baked, do not insert any keys into areas of the curve where animation is defined. And, use as few keys as possible to bake the pre and post infinity behavior. When this is false, one key will be inserted at each time step. The default is false.

        after: (create, edit) - If the default behavior for insertion/appending into/onto the existing chain is not the desired behavior then this flag can be used to force the command to place the deformer node after the selected node in the chain even if a new geometry shape has to be created in order to do so. Works in create mode (and edit mode if the deformer has no geometry added yet).
        afterReference: (create, edit) - The -afterReference flag is used to specify deformer ordering in a hybrid way that choses between -before and -after automatically. If the geometry being deformed is referenced then the -after mode is used when adding the new deformer, otherwise the -before mode is used. The net effect when using -afterReference to build deformer chains is that internal shape nodes in the deformer chain will only appear at reference file boundaries, leading to lightweight deformer networks that may be more amicable to reference swapping.
        automatic: (create, edit) - The -automatic flag is used to specify deformer ordering in a way that choses between -frontOfChain and -before automatically. If the geometry being deformed is only affected by invertible deformers, the -frontOfChain mode is used, otherwise the -before mode is used.
        before: (create, edit) - If the default behavior for insertion/appending into/onto the existing chain is not the desired behavior then this flag can be used to force the command to place the deformer node before the selected node in the chain even if a new geometry shape has to be created in order to do so. Works in create mode (and edit mode if the deformer has no geometry added yet).
        components: (query) - Returns the components used by the deformer
        copyDelta: (edit) - Set the base, source, and destination delta index values.
        copyInBetweenDelta: (edit) - Set the base, target, source, and destination delta index values.
        copyWeights: (edit) - Copy base, source, and destination weight index values.
        deformerTools: (query) - Returns the name of the deformer tool objects (if any) as string string ...
        envelope: (create, edit, query) - Set the envelope value for the deformer, controlling how much of the total deformation gets applied. Default is 1.0.
        exclusive: (create, query) - Puts the deformation set in a deform partition.
        export: (edit) - Export the shapes to the named file path.
        exportTarget: (edit, multiuse) - Specify the base and target index pairs for the export.
        flipTarget: (edit, multiuse) - Flip the list of base and target pairs.
        frontOfChain: (create, edit) - This command is used to specify that the new deformer node should be placed ahead (upstream) of existing deformer and skin nodes in the shape's history (but not ahead of existing tweak nodes). The input to the deformer will be the upstream shape rather than the visible downstream shape, so the behavior of this flag is the most intuitive if the downstream deformers are in their reset (hasNoEffect) position when the new deformer is added. Works in create mode (and edit mode if the deformer has no geometry added yet).
        geometry: (edit, multiuse, query) - The specified object will be added to the list of objects being deformed by this deformer object, unless the -rm flag is also specified. When queried, this flag returns string string string ...

        ignoreSelected: (create) - Tells the command to not deform objects on the current selection list
        ip: (edit) - Import the shapes from the named file path.
        inBetween: (create, edit) - Indicate that the specified target should serve as an inbetween. An inbetween target is one that serves as an intermediate target between the base shape and another target.
        inBetweenIndex: (edit) - Only used with the -rtd/-resetTargetDelta flag to remove delta values for points in the inbetween target geometry defined by this index.
        inBetweenType: (create, edit) - Specify if the in-between target to be created is relative to the hero target or if it is absolute. If it is relative to hero targets, the in-between target will get any changes made to the hero target. Valid values are "relative" and "absolute". This flag should always be used with the -ib/-inBetween and -t/-target flags.
        includeHiddenSelections: (create) - Apply the deformer to any visible and hidden objects in the selection list. Default is false.

    This command creates/edits/queries a boneLattice deformer. The name of the created/edited object is returned. Usually you would make use of this functionality through the higher level flexor command.

    Args:
        after: (create, edit) - If the default behavior for insertion/appending into/onto the existing chain is not the desired behavior then this flag can be used to force the command to place the deformer node after the selected node in the chain even if a new geometry shape has to be created in order to do so. Works in create mode (and edit mode if the deformer has no geometry added yet).
        afterReference: (create, edit) - The -afterReference flag is used to specify deformer ordering in a hybrid way that choses between -before and -after automatically. If the geometry being deformed is referenced then the -after mode is used when adding the new deformer, otherwise the -before mode is used. The net effect when using -afterReference to build deformer chains is that internal shape nodes in the deformer chain will only appear at reference file boundaries, leading to lightweight deformer networks that may be more amicable to reference swapping.
        before: (create, edit) - If the default behavior for insertion/appending into/onto the existing chain is not the desired behavior then this flag can be used to force the command to place the deformer node before the selected node in the chain even if a new geometry shape has to be created in order to do so. Works in create mode (and edit mode if the deformer has no geometry added yet).
        bicep: (create, edit, query) - Affects the bulging of lattice points on the inside of the bend. Positive/negative values cause the points to bulge outwards/inwards. Default value is 0.0. When queried, this flag returns a float.
        components: (query) - Returns the components used by the deformer
        deformerTools: (query) - Returns the name of the deformer tool objects (if any) as string string ...
        exclusive: (create, query) - Puts the deformation set in a deform partition.
        frontOfChain: (create, edit) - This command is used to specify that the new deformer node should be placed ahead (upstream) of existing deformer and skin nodes in the shape's history (but not ahead of existing tweak nodes). The input to the deformer will be the upstream shape rather than the visible downstream shape, so the behavior of this flag is the most intuitive if the downstream deformers are in their reset (hasNoEffect) position when the new deformer is added. Works in create mode (and edit mode if the deformer has no geometry added yet).
        geometry: (edit, multiuse, query) - The specified object will be added to the list of objects being deformed by this deformer object, unless the -rm flag is also specified. When queried, this flag returns string string string ...
        geometryIndices: (query) - Complements the -geometry flag in query mode. Returns the multi index of each geometry.
        ignoreSelected: (create) - Tells the command to not deform objects on the current selection list
        includeHiddenSelections: (create) - Apply the deformer to any visible and hidden objects in the selection list. Default is false.
        joint: (create, edit, query) - Specifies which joint will be used to drive the bulging behaviors.
        lengthIn: (create, edit, query) - Affects the location of lattice points along the upper half of the bone. Positive/negative values cause the points to move away/towards the center of the bone.  Changing this parameter also modifies the regions affected by the creasing, rounding and width parameters. Default value is 0.0. When queried, this flag returns a float.
        lengthOut: (create, edit, query) - Affects the location of lattice points along the lower half of the bone. Positive/negative values cause the points to move away/towards the center of the bone.  Changing this parameter also modifies the regions affected by the creasing, rounding and width parameters. Default value is 0.0. When queried, this flag returns a float.
        name: (create) - Used to specify the name of the node being created.
        parallel: (create, edit) - Inserts the new deformer in a parallel chain to any existing deformers in the history of the object. A blendShape is inserted to blend the parallel results together. Works in create mode (and edit mode if the deformer has no geometry added yet).
        prune: (edit) - Removes any points not being deformed by the deformer in its current configuration from the deformer set.
        remove: (edit, multiuse) - Specifies that objects listed after the -g flag should be removed from this deformer.
        selectedComponents: (query) - Returns the components used by the deformer that are currently selected. This intersects the current selection with the components affected by the deformer.
        split: (create, edit) - Branches off a new chain in the dependency graph instead of inserting/appending the deformer into/onto an existing chain. Works in create mode (and edit mode if the deformer has no geometry added yet).
        transform: (create) - Specifies which dag node is being used to rigidly transform the lattice which this node is going to deform.  If this flag is not specified an identity matrix will be assumed.
        tricep: (create, edit, query) - Affects the bulging of lattice points on the outside of the bend. Positive/negative values cause the points to bulge outwards/inwards. Default value is 0.0. When queried, this flag returns a float.
        useComponentTags: (create) - When this flag is specified a setup using componentTags will be created. This means no groupId, groupParts, tweak or objectSet nodes will be created and connected to the new deformer.
        widthLeft: (create, edit, query) - Affects the bulging of lattice points on the left side of the bend. Positive/negative values cause the points to bulge outwards/inwards. Default value is 0.0. When queried, this flag returns a float.
        widthRight: (create, edit, query) - Affects the bulging of lattice points on the right side of the bend. Positive/negative values cause the points to bulge outwards/inwards. Default value is 0.0. When queried, this flag returns a float.

        hierarchy: (create) - Hierarchy expansion options.  Valid values are "above," "below," "both," and "none." (Not valid for "pasteKey" cmd.) In query mode, this flag needs a value.
        includeUpperBound: (create) - When the -t/time or -f/float flags represent a range of keys, this flag determines whether the keys at the upper bound of the range are included in the keyset. Default value: true.  This flag is only valid when the argument to the -t/time flag is a time range with a lower and upper bound.  (When used with the "pasteKey" command, this flag refers only to the time range of the target curve that is replaced, when using options such as "replace," "fitReplace," or "scaleReplace."  This flag has no effect on the curve pasted from the clipboard.)
        index: (create, multiuse) - index of a key on an animCurve       In query mode, this flag needs a value.
        overwrite: (create) - Create a buffer curve.  "true" means create a buffer curve whether or not one already existed.  "false" means if a buffer curve exists already then leave it alone.  If no flag is specified, then the command defaults to -overwrite false
        shape: (create) - Consider attributes of shapes below transforms as well, except "controlPoints".  Default: true.  (Not valid for "pasteKey" cmd.) In query mode, this flag needs a value.
        swap: (create) - For animated attributes which have buffer curves, swap the buffer curve with the current animation curve
        time: (create, multiuse) - time uniquely representing a key (or key range) on a time-based animCurve. See the code examples below on how to format for a single frame or frame ranges.       In query mode, this flag needs a value.
        useReferencedCurve: (create, query) - In create mode, sets the buffer curve to the referenced curve. Curves which are not from file references will ignore this flag.

    """
    

    Args:
        cacheFillMode: (create, query) - Specifies the cache fill mode. Valid values are: "syncOnly" to fill cache during playback, "syncAsync" to cache during playback and in background,  and "asyncOnly" to fill cache only in background. Query returns current mode.
        cacheFillOrder: (create, query) - Specifies in which order the cache fills the timeline. Valid values are: "forward" to fill cache in forward direction, "backward" to fill cache backwards, "bidirectional" to fill cache in forward and backward directions simultaneously,  and "forwardFromBegin" to fill cache in forward direction from animation start.  Query returns current cache fill mode.
        cacheInvalidate: (create) - Specifies the frame range in which cache should be invalidated. The range should be specified as a pair of positive integers.      Usage examples:       -ci "10:20"{Python equivalent: ('10','20')} means all frames         in the range from 10 to 20, inclusive, in the current time unit.        Omitting one end of a range means using either end of the animation range      (or both), as in the following examples:       -ci "10:" means all frames from time 10 (in the current time unit)         onwards to the maximum time in the animation range (on the timeline).   -ci ":10" means all frames from the minimum time on the animation range         (on the timeline) up to (and including) time 10 (in the current time unit).   -ci ":" is a short form to specify all frames, from minimum to         maximum time on the current animation range.
        cacheName: (query) - Specifies the name of the cache from which to query a value. 			In query mode, this flag needs a value.
        cachedFrames: (query) - Get the list of frames with valid cache data. The result is an integer array containing multiple triplets of (cache-status, begin-frame, end-frame) For example, The result is an array of 9 integers [(0b01, 1, 3), (0b10, 7, 10), (0b11, 13, 15)]. In MEL, the result is typed as "int[9]". In Python, the result is typed as "Tuple[int,int,int][3]". The result suggests frames 1:3 (1,2,3), 7:10 (7,8,9,19), and 13:15 (13,14,15) are cached. No other frames contain valid cache data. The cache-status numbers are always 1 if "layeredEvaluationActive" is false. The cache-status can be one of {1,2,3}, when "layeredEvaluationActive" is true. It represents whether the frame is valid on animation cache or dynamics cache, the encoding is:  1 (0b01) : only animation cache is valid 2 (0b10) : only dynamics cache is valid 3 (0b11) : both animation and dynamics cache are valid  In the above example, it suggests: frames 1:3 are only valid in animation cache. frames 7:10 are only valid in dynamics cache. frames 13:15 are valid in both and considered as 'fully-cached'.
        cachingPoints: (query) - Get list of nodes marked as caching points, i.e. nodes with at least one type of cache active.
        creationParameters: (query) - Get the current mode creation parameters.  The result is a JSON string which represents an array with an element for each rule.  Each element is an association between the parameter name and its value when creating the rule.
        delegateEvaluation: (query) - Returns whether the specified node(s) are delegating to evaluation.
        dynamicsAsyncRefresh: (create, query) - Enable / Disable Asynchronous Refresh in Dynamics Support mode. Traditionally, edits related to the simulation system require the user to re-playback the scene to see the result. When Asynchronous Refresh is active, Maya will process the simulation in the background and refresh the viewport once the result is ready. Note, the automatic refresh will not happen if the frame contains temproary edits. For example, an object is moved without setting the keyframe.
        dynamicsSupportActive: (query) - Query if the Dynamics Support mode is active. Dynamics Support mode is used to support Physics Simulation, such as Hair, or Fluid. It will be activated if such nodes are detected in the scene, and "enableDynamicsSupport" is set to true. When Dynamics Support mode is active, you will notice the following behavior:  Dynamics nodes will be frozen for uncached frame A separate dynamics cache line will appear on the Time Slider Dynamics cache starts after the animation cache was filled Dynamics cache only fills in the background Dynamics cache always fills forward from the beginning Dynamics cache evaluation may refresh foreground dynamics nodes (see the flag "dynamicsAsyncRefresh")
        dynamicsSupportEnabled: (create, query) - Specifies if Dynamics nodes are allowed to participate in Cached Playback When disabled, Dynamics nodes will trigger "Safe mode" and prevent caching. When enabled, Dynamics nodes will participate in caching and trigger "Dynamics support mode". For more information check flag "dynamicsSupportActive".
        flushCache: (create) - Specifies to flush the current cache. Valid values are: "keep" to store the existing cache as backup, and "destroy" to delete the current cache.
        flushCacheRange: (create) - Specifies the frame range in which cache should be flushed. By default it will destroy the cache - if the 'flushCache' is also set then it will define what to do with the cache range being flushed. The range should be specified as a pair of positive integers and a boolean.      Usage examples:       -flushCacheRange "10:20" on {Python equivalent: ('10','20',True)}                 means all frames in the range from 10 to 20, inclusive, in the current time unit.   -flushCacheRange "12:18" off {Python equivalent: ('12','18',False)}                 means all frames before 12 and after 18, not inclusive, in the current time unit.        Omitting one end of a range means using either end of the animation range      (or both), as in the following examples:       -flushCacheRange "10:" on means all frames from time 10 (in the current time unit)         onwards to the maximum time in the animation range (on the timeline).   -flushCacheRange ":10" on means all frames from the minimum time on the animation range         (on the timeline) up to (and including) time 10 (in the current time unit).   -flushCacheRange ":" on is a short form to specify all frames, from minimum to         maximum time on the current animation range.
        flushCacheSync: (create, query) - Specifies how to flush the cache: synchronously or asynchronously. True for synchronous, False for asynchronous.
        flushCacheWait: (create) - Wait for the cache destruction to be completed.
        hybridCacheMode: (create, query) - Specifies the hybrid cache mode. Valid values are: "disabled", not to use hybrid cache; "smp", to evaluate on the GPU meshes with GPU-supported deformation stacks if they use Smooth Mesh Preview (instead of caching them); "all", to evaluate on the GPU all meshes with PU-supported deformation stacks (instead of caching them). Query returns current mode.
        layeredEvaluationActive: (query) - Query if the Layered Evaluation mode is active. When Layered Evaluation is active, the background cache fill process will be split into multiple passes for different contents (evaluation nodes). These contents are referred as different 'evaluation layers', representing different level of details (LoD) in animation evaluation. For example:  The first layer contains regular animations like a character motion.  The second layer contains dynamics simulations like a character's hair and cloth.   Maya will create separated cache and cache fill pass for each of the layers. Additional cache bars will be added to the Time Slider UI to represent these layers. The background cache fill pass for each of the layer will start in order. In the above example, two passes of background cache fill will be observed. In the first pass of background-cache-fill or playback-fill, only Character motions will be evaluated and filled, Hair and Clothes are frozen in-place. After the cache for first layer have been filled for all the frames, the second pass of cache fill will start to simulate Hairs and Clothes physics and fill the cache for the 2nd layer. Once the cache for the 2nd layer is filled for a frame, users can scrub the timeline to view the fully updated effects. Note, when layered evaluation is active, any foreground playback or manipulation will only evaluate the first evaluation layer, and all the FX contents will be frozen in the viewport until the background simulation is complete. For example, when rotating a character’s head, its hair will not follow in real time. If the flag "dynamicsAsyncRefresh" is enabled, the FX contents will be updated automatically after simulation cached up. Please refer to the flag for more detail.
        layeredEvaluationCachingPoints: (query) - Get the list of nodes marked as caching points because of layered evaluation.
        layeredEvaluationEnabled: (create, query) - Enable / Disable Layered Evaluation in Dynamics Support mode. Refering to flags "dynamicsSupportActive" and "layeredEvaluationActive" for details about layered evaluation enabled behavior. This flag is provided to support plugin developers for testing purpose. Disabling this option in production is not recommended. When disabled, dynamics nodes will share the same cache with regular animation. Allows dynamics nodes to be evaluated and stored to cache in the foreground. Background "cacheFillOrder" option will be locked to "forwardFromBegin". When used with cacheFillMode="syncOnly", it can also be used to support legacy dynamics nodes that cannot evaluate in the background.
        listCacheNames: (query) - Return the list of existing cache names.
        listCachedNodes: (query) - Returns the list of cached nodes.
        listValueNames: (query) - Return the list of value names that can be queried for the given cache.
        newAction: (create) - Specifies the name of the new action to create in the new filter/action rule.
        newActionParam: (create) - Specifies the parameter string to pass to the new action to create in the new filter/action rule.
        newFilter: (create) - Specifies the name of the new filter to create in the new filter/action rule.
        newFilterParam: (create) - Specifies the parameter string to pass to the new filter to create in the new filter/action rule.
        newRule: (create) - Specifies the name of the new rule to create.
        newRuleParam: (create) - Specifies the parameter string to pass to the new rule to create.
        pauseInvalidation: (create, query) - Pause all incoming invalidation of the cache. Work in symmetry with resumeInvalidation flag. PauseInvalidation can be called several time, useful in nesting situation. The same number of resume need to be called to resume the invalidation. If queried it will return how much time caching is paused, 0 means it is resumed.
        preventFrameSkip: (create, query) - Specifies if frame skipping is enabled. Following behavior is seen when frame skipping is enabled, and playback is set to play in real-time.  If cache can't be filled at real-time frame rate, frames will NOT be skipped. Once all frames have been looped over(and therefore all frames are cached), and if     playing back from cache still can't be done at real-time frame rate; frames WILL be skipped. If memory limit is reached before all frames are cached, frames WILL be skipped. If cache is invalidated will playing(like flushing it), frames will NOT     be skipped(until the cache is full again).
        resetRules: (create) - Reset the cache configuration rules to an empty set of rules.
        resourceUsage: (query) - Returns the current state of the resource usage as a string. 'unlimited' = the resource limits are being ignored, 'out' = the memory limit has been reached, 'low' = the memory usage is at 90% of the specified limit, 'okay' = memory usage is under 90% of the specified limit.
        resumeInvalidation: (create, query) - Resume all incoming invalidation of the cache. Work in symmetry with pauseInvalidation flag. PauseInvalidation can be called several time, useful in nesting situation. The same number of resume need to be called to resume the invalidation. If queried it will return true if cache is resumed, false otherwise.
        safeMode: (create, query) - Turns safe mode on or off. In query mode, it returns the status of the safe mode for cache evaluator.
        safeModeMessages: (query) - Prints the safe mode messages to the console.
        safeModeTriggered: (query) - Returns if the safe mode was triggered for cache evaluator.
        valueName: (query) - Specifies the name of the parameter for which to query the value. 			In query mode, this flag needs a value.
        waitForCache: (create) - Specifies to wait for cache to fill in background, with [Time to wait in seconds] timeout.

When another character is passed to to -addElement, is is added as a sub character.  When a node is passed in, it is expanded into its keyable attributes, which are then added to the character.
        addOffsetObject: (edit, query) - Indicates that the selected character member objects should be used when calculating and applying offsets. The flag argument is used to specify the character.
        anyMember: (create) - An operation which tests whether any of the given items are members of the given set.
        characterPlug: (query) - Returns the plug on the character that corresponds to the specified character member.
        clear: (edit) - An operation which removes all items from the given character.

        excludeScale: (create) - When creating the character, exclude scale attributes from transform-type nodes.
        excludeTranslate: (create) - When creating the character, exclude translate attributes from transform-type nodes. For example, if your character contains joints only, perhaps you only want to include rotations in the character.
        excludeVisibility: (create) - When creating the character, exclude visibility attribute from transform-type nodes.
        flatten: (edit) - An operation that flattens the structure of the given character. That is, any characters contained by the given character will be replaced by its members so that the character no longer contains other characters but contains the other characters' members.
        forceElement: (edit) - For use in edit mode only. Forces addition of the items to the character. If the items are in another character which is in the character partition, the items will be removed from the other character in order to keep the characters in the character partition mutually exclusive with respect to membership.
        include: (edit) - Adds the list of items to the given character.  If some of the items cannot be added to the character, a warning will be issued. This is a less strict version of the -add/addElement operation.
        intersection: (query) - An operation that returns a list of items which are members of all the character in the list.  In general, characters should be mutually exclusive.
        isIntersecting: (query) - An operation which tests whether or not the characters in the list have common members.  In general, characters should be mutually exclusive, so this should always return false.
        isMember: (query) - An operation which tests whether or not all the given items are members of the given character.

        memberIndex: (query) - Returns the memberIndex of the specified character member if used after the query flag. Or if used before the query flag, returns the member that corresponds to the specified index.
        name: (create) - Assigns string as the name for a new character. Valid for operations that create a new character.
        noWarnings: (create) - Indicates that warning messages should not be reported such as when trying to add an invalid item to a character. (used by UI)
        nodesOnly: (query) - This flag modifies the results of character membership queries. When listing the attributes (e.g. sphere1.tx) contained in the character, list only the nodes.  Each node will only be listed once, even if more than one attribute or component of the node exists in the character.
        offsetNode: (query) - Returns the name of the characterOffset node used to add offsets to the root of the character.
        remove: (edit) - Removes the list of items from the given character.
        removeOffsetObject: (edit) - Indicates that the selected character offset objects should be removed as offsets. The flag argument is used to specify the character.
        root: (create) - Specifies the transform node which will act as the root of the character being created. This creates a characterOffset node in addition to the character node, which can be used to add offsets to the character to change the direction of the character's animtion without inserting additional nodes in its hierarchy.
        scheduler: (query) - Returns the scheduler associated with this character, if there is one. A scheduler will only exist if you have created clips on your character.
        split: (create) - Produces a new set with the list of items and removes each item in the list of items from the given set.
        subtract: (query) - An operation between two characters which returns the members of the first character that are not in the second character. In general, characters should be mutually exclusive.
        text: (create, edit, query) - Defines an annotation string to be stored with the character.
        union: (query) - An operation that returns a list of all the members of all characters listed.
        userAlias: (query) - Returns the user defined alias for the given attribute on the character or and empty string if there is not one.  Characters automatically alias the attributes where character animation data is stored.  A user alias will exist when the automatic aliases are overridden using the aliasAttr command.

    This command is used to scan a joint hierarchy for predefined joint names or labels. If the required joints are found, human IK effectors will be created to control the skeleton using full-body IK. Alternatively, you can manually create all of the components required for fullbody IK, and use this command to hook them up. Fullbody IK needs 3 major components: the user input skeleton (sk), the fk skeleton on which keys are set (fk) and the hik effectors (ik).  Together fk and ik provide parameters to the fullbody IK engine, which solves for the output and plots it onto sk. This command usage is used internally by Maya when importing data from fbx files, but is not generally recommended.

    Args:
        activatePivot: (edit) - Activates a pivot that has been properly placed.  After activating this new pivot, you will now be able to rotate and translate about this pivot. A pivot behaves in all ways the same as an effector (it IS an effector, except that it is offset from the normal position of the effector to allow one to rotate about a different point.
        addAuxEffector: (edit) - Adds an auxilliary (secondary) effector to an existing effector.
        addFloorContactPlane: (edit) - Adds a floor contact plane to one of the hands or feet.  With this plane, you will be able to adjust the floor contact height.  Select a hand or foot effector and then issue the characterize command with this flag.
        addMissingEffectors: (edit) - This flag tells the characterize command to look for any effectors that can be added to the skeleton. For example, if the user has deleted some effectors or added fingers to an existing skeleton, "characterize -e -addMissingEffectors" can be used to restore them.
        attributeFromHIKProperty: (query) - Query for the attribute name associated with a MotionBuilder property.
        attributeFromHIKPropertyMode: (query) - Query for the attribute name associated with a MotionBuilder property mode.
        autoActivateBodyPart: (edit, query) - Query or change whether auto activation of character nodes representing body parts should be enabled.
        changePivotPlacement: (edit) - Reverts a pivot back into pivot placement mode.  A pivot that is in placement mode will not participate in full body manipulation until it has been activated with the -activatePivot flag.
        effectors: (create) - Specify the effectors to be used by human IK by providing 2 pieces of information for each effector:  1) the partial path of the effector and 2) the name of the full body effector this represents.  1) and 2) are to be separated by white space, and multiple entries separated by ",". Normally, the effectors are automatically created.  This flag is for advanced users only.
        fkSkeleton: (create, edit) - Specify the fk skeleton to be used by human IK by providing 2 pieces of information for each joint of the FK skeleton:  1) the partial path of the joint and 2) the name of the full body joint this represents.  1) and 2) are to be separated by white space, and multiple entries separated by ",". Normally, the fk control skeleton is automatically created.  This flag is for advanced users only.
        name: (create) - At characterization (FBIK creation) time, use this flag to name your FBIK character. This will affect the name of the hikHandle node and the control rig will be put into a namespace that matches the name of your character.  If you do not specify the character name, a default one will be used. At the moment edit and query of the character name is not supported.
        pinHandFeet: (create) - When the character is first being characterized, pin the hands and feet by default.
        placeNewPivot: (edit) - Creates a new pivot and puts it into placement mode.  Note that you will not be able to do full body manipulation about this pivot until you have activated it with the -activatePivot flag. A pivot behaves in all ways the same as an effector (it IS an effector, except that it is offset from the normal position of the effector to allow one to rotate about a different point). A new pivot created with this flag allow you to adjust the offset interactively before activating it.
        posture: (create) - Specifies the posture of the character. Valid options are "biped" and "quadruped". The default is "biped".
        sourceSkeleton: (create, edit) - This flag can be used to characterize a skeleton that has not been named or labelled according to the FBIK guidelines. It specifies the association between the actual joint names and the expected FBIK joint names. The format of the string is as follows: For each joint that the user wants to involve in the solve:  1) the partial path of the joint and 2) the name of the full body joint this represents.  1) and 2) are to be separated by white space, and multiple entries separated by ",".
        stancePose: (create, query) - Specify the default stance pose to be used by human IK.  The stance pose is specified by providing 2 pieces of information for each joint involved in the solve: 1) the partial path to the joint and 2) 9 numbers representing translation rotation and scale. 1) and 2) are to be separated by white space, and multiple entries separated by ",". Normally, the stance pose is taken from the selected skeleton.  This flag is for advanced users only.
        type: (create) - Specifies the technique used by the characterization to identify the joint type. Valid options are "label" and "name". When "label" is used, the joints must be labelled using the guidelines described in the Maya documentation. When name is used, the joint names must follow the naming conventions described in the Maya documentation. The default is "name". This flag cannot be used in conjunction with the sourceSkeleton flag.

In non-query mode, this flag can be used to create a mapping between the specified character members. Any previous mapping on the attributes is removed in favor of the newly specified mapping.
        mapMethod: (create) - This is is valid in create mode only. It specifies how the mapping should be done. Valid options are: "byNodeName", "byAttrName", and "byAttrOrder". "byAttrOrder" is the default. The flags mean the following: "byAttrOrder" maps using the order that the character stores the attributes internally, "byAttrName" uses the attribute name to find a correspondence, "byNodeName" uses the node name *and* the attribute name to find a correspondence.

    The choice command provides a mechanism for changing the inputs to an attribute based on some (usually time-based) criteria. For example, an object could be animated from frames 1 to 30 by a motion path, then from frames 30 to 50 it follows keyframe animation, and after frame 50 it returns to the motion path. Or, a revolve surface could change its input curve depending on some transform's rotation value.

    Args:
        attribute: (create, multiuse) - specifies the attributes onto which choice node(s) should be created. The default is all keyable attributes of the given objects.

        controlPoints: (create) - Explicitly specify whether or not to include the control points of a shape (see "-s" flag) in the list of attributes. Default: false.
        index: (create, query) - specifies the multi-input index of the choice node to connect the source attribute to. When queried, returns a list of integers one per specified -t/time that indicates the multi-index of the choice node to use at that time.
        name: (create, query) - the name to give to any newly created choice node(s). When queried, returns a list of strings.
        selector: (create, query) - specifies the attribute to be used as the choice node's selector. The value of the selector at a given time determines which of the choice node's multi-indices should be used as the output of the choice node at that time. This flag is only editable (it cannot be specified at creation time). When queried, returns a list of strings.

    This command is used to create, edit and query character clips.

    Args:
        absolute: (create) - This flag is now deprecated.  Use aa/allAbsolute, ar/allRelative, ra/rotationsAbsolute, or da/defaultAbsolute instead.  This flag controls whether the clip follows its keyframe values or whether they are offset by a value to maintain a smooth path. Default is true.
        absoluteRotations: (create) - This flag is now deprecated.  Use aa/allAbsolute, ar/allRelative, ra/rotationsAbsolute, or da/defaultAbsolute instead. If true, this overrides the -absolute flag so that rotation channels are always calculated with absolute offsets. This allows you to have absolute offsets on rotations and relative offsets on all other channels.
        active: (edit, query) - Query or edit the active clip. This flag is not valid in create mode. Making a clip active causes its animCurves to be hooked directly to the character attributes in addition to being attached to the clip library node. This makes it easier to access the animCurves if you want to edit, delete or add additional animCruves to the clip.
        addTrack: () - This flag is now obsolete. Use the insertTrack flag on the clipSchedule command instead.
        allAbsolute: (create) - Set all channels to be calculated with absolute offsets.  This flag cannot be used in conjunction with the ar/allRelative, ra/rotationsAbsolute or da/defaultAbsolute flags.
        allClips: (query) - This flag is used to query all the clips in the scene. Nodes of type "animClip" that are storing poses, are not returned by this command.
        allRelative: (create) - Set all channels to be calculated with relative offsets.  This flag cannot be used in conjunction with the aa/allAbsolute, ra/rotationsAbsolute or da/defaultAbsolute flags.
        allSourceClips: (query) - This flag is used to query all the source clips in the scene. Nodes of type "animClip" that are storing poses or clip instances, are not returned by this command.
        animCurveRange: (create) - This flag can be used at the time you create the clip instead of the startTime and endTime flags. It specifies that you want the range of the clip to span the range of keys in the clips associated animCurves.
        character: (query) - This is a query only flag which operates on the specified clip. It returns the names of any characters that a clip is associated with.
        constraint: (create) - This creates a clip out of any constraints on the character. The constraint will be moved off of the character and into the clip, so that it is only active for the duration of the clip, and its value can be scaled/offset/cycled according to the clip attributes.
        copy: (create, query) - This flag is used to copy a clip or clips to the clipboard. It should be used in conjunction with the name flag to copy the named clips on the specified character and its subcharacters. In query mode, this flag allows you to query what, if anything, has been copied into the clip clipboard.
        defaultAbsolute: (create) - Sets all top-level channels except rotations in the clip to relative, and the remaining channels to absolute. This is the default during clip creation if no offset flag is specified.  This flag cannot be used in conjunction with the aa/allAbsolute, ar/allRelative, or ra/rotationsAbsolute flags.
        duplicate: (query) - Duplicate the clip specified by the name flag. The start time of the new clip should be specified with the startTime flag.
        endTime: (create, edit, query) - Specify the clip end
        expression: (create) - This creates a clip out of any expressions on the character. The expression will be moved off of the character and into the clip, so that it is only active for the duration of the clip, and its value can be scaled/offset/cycled according to the clip attributes.
        ignoreSubcharacters: (create) - During clip creation, duplication and isolation, subcharacters are included by default. If you want to create a clip on the top level character only, or you want to duplicate the clip on the top level character without including subCharacters, use the ignoreSubcharacters flag.
        isolate: (create) - This flag should be used in conjunction with the name flag to specify that a clip or clips should be copied to a new clip library. The most common use of this flag is for export, when you want to only export certain clips from the character, without exporting all of the clips.
        leaveOriginal: (create) - This flag is used when creating a clip to specify that the animation curves should be copied to the clip library, and left on the character.
        mapMethod: (create) - This is is valid with the paste and pasteInstance flags only. It specifies how the mapping should be done. Valid options are: "byNodeName", "byAttrName", "byCharacterMap", "byAttrOrder", "byMapOrAttrName" and "byMapOrNodeName". "byAttrName" is the default. The flags mean the following: "byAttrOrder" maps using the order that the character stores the attributes internally, "byAttrName" uses the attribute name to find a correspondence, "byNodeName" uses the node name *and* the attribute name to find a correspondence, "byCharacterMap" uses the existing characterMap node to do the mapping. "byMapOrAttrName" uses a character map if one exists, otherwise uses the attribute name. "byMapOrNodeName" uses a character map if one exists, otherwise uses the attribute name.
        name: (create, multiuse, query) - In create mode, specify the clip name. In query mode, return a list of all the clips. In duplicate mode, specify the clip to be duplicated. In copy mode, specify the clip to be copied. This flag is multi-use, but multiple use is only supported with the copy flag. For use during create and with all other flags, only the first instance of the name flag will be utilized. 			In query mode, this flag can accept a value.
        newName: (create) - Rename a clip. Must be used in conjunction with the clip name flag, which is used to specify the clip to be renamed.
        paste: (create) - This flag is used to paste a clip or clips from the clipboard to a character. Clips are added to the clipboard using the c/copy flag.
        pasteInstance: (create) - This flag is used to paste an instance of a clip or clips from the clipboard to a character. Unlike the p/paste flag, which duplicates the animCurves from the original source clip, the pi/pasteInstance flag shares the animCurves from the source clip.
        remove: (query) - Remove the clip specified by the name flag. The clip will be permanently removed from the library and deleted from any times where it has been scheduled.
        removeTrack: (create) - This flag is now obsolete. Use removeTrack flag on the clipSchedule command instead.
        rotationOffset: (create, query) - Return the channel offsets used to modify the clip's rotation.
        rotationsAbsolute: (create) - Set all channels except rotations to be calculated with relative offsets.  Rotation channels will be calculated with absolute offsets.  This flag cannot be used in conjunction with the aa/allAbsolute, ar/allRelative or da/defaultAbsolute flags.
        scheduleClip: (create) - This flag is used when creating a clip to specify whether or not the clip should immediately be scheduled at the current time. If the clip is not scheduled, the clip will be placed in the library for future use, but will not be placed on the timeline. This flag is for use only when creating a new clip or duplicating an existing. The default is true.
        sourceClipName: (query) - This flag is for query only. It returns the name of the source clip that controls an instanced clip.
        split: (create, edit) - Split an existing clip into two clips. The split occurs around the specified time.
        startTime: (create, edit, query) - Specify the clip start
        translationOffset: (create, query) - Return the channel offsets used to modify the clip's translation.
        useChannel: (create, multiuse) - Specify which channels should be acted on. This flag is valid only in conjunction with clip creation, and the isolate flag. The specified channels must be members of the character.

    This command creates/edits/queries a clip scheduler outliner control.

    Args:
        annotation: (create, edit, query) - Annotate the control with an extra string value.
        backgroundColor: (create, edit, query) - The background color of the control. The arguments correspond to the red, green, and blue color components. Each component ranges in value from 0.0 to 1.0. When setting backgroundColor, the background is automatically enabled, unless enableBackground is also specified with a false value.
        clipScheduler: (edit) - Name of the clip scheduler for which to display information.
        defineTemplate: (create) - Puts the command in a mode where any other flags and arguments are parsed and added to the command template specified in the argument. They will be used as default arguments in any subsequent invocations of the command when templateName is set as the current template.
        docTag: (create, edit, query) - Add a documentation flag to the control.  The documentation flag has a directory structure. (e.g., -dt render/multiLister/createNode/material)
        dragCallback: (create, edit) - Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:  global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods)  The proc returns a string array that is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type.  Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers CTRL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTRL, 3 == CTRL + SHIFT.  In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form:  def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ):  The values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above.  The other way to specify the callback in Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys "dragControl", "x", "y", "modifiers".  The "dragControl" value is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be "print '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'")
        dropCallback: (create, edit) - Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:  global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int $y, int $type)  The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback. $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link.  In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form:  def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ):  The values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above.  The other way to specify the callback in Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys "dragControl", "dropControl", "messages", "x", "y", "type".  The "dragControl" value is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be "print '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'")
        enable: (create, edit, query) - The enable state of the control.  By default, this flag is set to true and the control is enabled.  Specify false and the control will appear dimmed or greyed-out indicating it is disabled.
        enableBackground: (create, edit, query) - Enables the background color of the control.
        enableKeyboardFocus: (create, edit, query) - If enabled, the user can navigate to the control with the tab key and select values with the keyboard or mouse. This flag would typically be used to turn off focus support from controls that get it by default, like Edit and List controls. If disabled, text in text fields can still be selected with the mouse but cannot be copied (except on Linux when "Middle Click Paste" is enabled).
        exists: (create) - Returns whether the specified object exists or not. Other flags are ignored.
        fullPathName: (query) - Return the full path name of the widget, which includes all the parents.
        height: (create, edit, query) - The height of the control.  The control will attempt to be this size if it is not overruled by parent layout conditions.
        highlightColor: (create, edit, query) - The highlight color of the control. The arguments correspond to the red, green, and blue color components. Each component ranges in value from 0.0 to 1.0.
        isObscured: (query) - Return whether the control can actually be seen by the user. The control will be obscured if its state is invisible, if it is blocked (entirely or partially) by some other control, if it or a parent layout is unmanaged, or if the control's window is invisible or iconified.
        manage: (create, edit, query) - Manage state of the control.  An unmanaged control is not visible, nor does it take up any screen real estate.  All controls are created managed by default.
        noBackground: (create, edit) - Clear/reset the control's background. Passing true means the background should not be drawn at all, false means the background should be drawn.  The state of this flag is inherited by children of this control.
        numberOfPopupMenus: (query) - Return the number of popup menus attached to this control.
        parent: (create, query) - The parent layout for this control.
        popupMenuArray: (query) - Return the names of all the popup menus attached to this control.
        preventOverride: (create, edit, query) - If true, this flag prevents overriding the control's attribute via the control's right mouse button menu.
        statusBarMessage: (create, edit) - Extra string to display in the status bar when the mouse is over the control.
        useTemplate: (create) - Forces the command to use a command template other than the current one.
        visible: (create, edit, query) - The visible state of the control.  A control is created visible by default.  Note that a control's actual appearance is also dependent on the visible state of its parent layout(s).
        visibleChangeCommand: (create, edit, query) - Command that gets executed when visible state of the control changes.
        width: (create, edit, query) - The width of the control.  The control will attempt to be this size if it is not overruled by parent layout conditions.

    The cluster command creates a cluster or edits the membership of an existing cluster. The command returns the name of the cluster node upon creation of a new cluster.

    Args:
        after: (create, edit) - If the default behavior for insertion/appending into/onto the existing chain is not the desired behavior then this flag can be used to force the command to place the deformer node after the selected node in the chain even if a new geometry shape has to be created in order to do so. Works in create mode (and edit mode if the deformer has no geometry added yet).
        afterReference: (create, edit) - The -afterReference flag is used to specify deformer ordering in a hybrid way that choses between -before and -after automatically. If the geometry being deformed is referenced then the -after mode is used when adding the new deformer, otherwise the -before mode is used. The net effect when using -afterReference to build deformer chains is that internal shape nodes in the deformer chain will only appear at reference file boundaries, leading to lightweight deformer networks that may be more amicable to reference swapping.
        before: (create, edit) - If the default behavior for insertion/appending into/onto the existing chain is not the desired behavior then this flag can be used to force the command to place the deformer node before the selected node in the chain even if a new geometry shape has to be created in order to do so. Works in create mode (and edit mode if the deformer has no geometry added yet).
        bindState: (create) - When turned on, this flag adds in a compensation to ensure the clustered objects preserve their spatial position when clustered. This is required to prevent the geometry from jumping at the time the cluster is created in situations when the cluster transforms at cluster time are not identity.
        components: (query) - Returns the components used by the deformer
        deformerTools: (query) - Returns the name of the deformer tool objects (if any) as string string ...
        envelope: (create, edit, query) - Set the envelope value for the deformer. Default is 1.0
        exclusive: (create, query) - Puts the deformation set in a deform partition.
        frontOfChain: (create, edit) - This command is used to specify that the new deformer node should be placed ahead (upstream) of existing deformer and skin nodes in the shape's history (but not ahead of existing tweak nodes). The input to the deformer will be the upstream shape rather than the visible downstream shape, so the behavior of this flag is the most intuitive if the downstream deformers are in their reset (hasNoEffect) position when the new deformer is added. Works in create mode (and edit mode if the deformer has no geometry added yet).
        geometry: (edit, multiuse, query) - The specified object will be added to the list of objects being deformed by this deformer object, unless the -rm flag is also specified. When queried, this flag returns string string string ...
        geometryIndices: (query) - Complements the -geometry flag in query mode. Returns the multi index of each geometry.
        ignoreSelected: (create) - Tells the command to not deform objects on the current selection list
        includeHiddenSelections: (create) - Apply the deformer to any visible and hidden objects in the selection list. Default is false.
        name: (create) - Used to specify the name of the node being created.
        parallel: (create, edit) - Inserts the new deformer in a parallel chain to any existing deformers in the history of the object. A blendShape is inserted to blend the parallel results together. Works in create mode (and edit mode if the deformer has no geometry added yet).
        prune: (edit) - Removes any points not being deformed by the deformer in its current configuration from the deformer set.
        relative: (create) - Enable relative mode for the cluster. In relative mode, Only the transformations directly above the cluster are used by the cluster. Default is off.
        remove: (edit, multiuse) - Specifies that objects listed after the -g flag should be removed from this deformer.
        resetGeometry: (edit) - Reset the geometry matrices for the objects being deformed by the cluster. This flag is used to get rid of undesirable effects that happen if you scale an object that is deformed by a cluster.
        selectedComponents: (query) - Returns the components used by the deformer that are currently selected. This intersects the current selection with the components affected by the deformer.
        split: (create, edit) - Branches off a new chain in the dependency graph instead of inserting/appending the deformer into/onto an existing chain. Works in create mode (and edit mode if the deformer has no geometry added yet).
        useComponentTags: (create) - When this flag is specified a setup using componentTags will be created. This means no groupId, groupParts, tweak or objectSet nodes will be created and connected to the new deformer.
        weightedNode: (create, edit, query) - Transform node in the DAG above the cluster to which all percents are applied. The second DAGobject specifies the descendent of the first DAGobject from where the transformation matrix is evaluated. Default is the cluster handle.

The net effect when using -afterReference to build deformer chains is that internal shape nodes in the deformer chain will only appear at reference file boundaries, leading to lightweight deformer networks that may be more amicable to reference swapping.
        before: (create, edit) - If the default behavior for insertion/appending into/onto the existing chain is not the desired behavior then this flag can be used to force the command to place the deformer node before the selected node in the chain even if a new geometry shape has to be created in order to do so. Works in create mode (and edit mode if the deformer has no geometry added yet).
        components: (query) - Returns the components used by the deformer
        deformerTools: (query) - Returns the name of the deformer tool objects (if any) as string string ...
        exclusive: (create, query) - Puts the deformation set in a deform partition.
        frontOfChain: (create, edit) - This command is used to specify that the new deformer node should be placed ahead (upstream) of existing deformer and skin nodes in the shape's history (but not ahead of existing tweak nodes). The input to the deformer will be the upstream shape rather than the visible downstream shape, so the behavior of this flag is the most intuitive if the downstream deformers are in their reset (hasNoEffect) position when the new deformer is added. Works in create mode (and edit mode if the deformer has no geometry added yet).
        geometry: (edit, multiuse, query) - The specified object will be added to the list of objects being deformed by this deformer object, unless the -rm flag is also specified. When queried, this flag returns string string string ...
        geometryIndices: (query) - Complements the -geometry flag in query mode. Returns the multi index of each geometry.
        ignoreSelected: (create) - Tells the command to not deform objects on the current selection list
        includeHiddenSelections: (create) - Apply the deformer to any visible and hidden objects in the selection list. Default is false.
        name: (create) - Used to specify the name of the node being created.
        parallel: (create, edit) - Inserts the new deformer in a parallel chain to any existing deformers in the history of the object. A blendShape is inserted to blend the parallel results together. Works in create mode (and edit mode if the deformer has no geometry added yet).
        prune: (edit) - Removes any points not being deformed by the deformer in its current configuration from the deformer set.
        remove: (edit, multiuse) - Specifies that objects listed after the -g flag should be removed from this deformer.
        selectedComponents: (query) - Returns the components used by the deformer that are currently selected. This intersects the current selection with the components affected by the deformer.
        split: (create, edit) - Branches off a new chain in the dependency graph instead of inserting/appending the deformer into/onto an existing chain. Works in create mode (and edit mode if the deformer has no geometry added yet).
        type: (create) - Specify the type of deformer to create. This flag is required in create mode. Typically the type should specify a loaded plugin deformer. This command should typically not be used to create one of the standard deformers such as sculpt, lattice, blendShape, wire and cluster, since they have their own customized commands which perform useful specialized functionality.
        useComponentTags: (create) - When this flag is specified a setup using componentTags will be created. This means no groupId, groupParts, tweak or objectSet nodes will be created and connected to the new deformer.

    Command to import and export deformer weights to and from a simple XML file. The weight data is stored in a per-vertex fashion along with a "point cloud" corresponding to the vertices from the geometry input to the deformer. For example a cluster deformer would have the following information:

    Args:
        attribute: (create, edit, multiuse, query) - Specify the long name of deformer attribute that should be imported/exported along with the deformerWeights. i.e. -at "envelope" -at "skinningMethod" etc.. No warning or error is given if a specified attribute does not exist on a particular deformer, making it possible to use this command with multiple deformers without aborting or slowing down the import/export process.  Currently supports numeric attributes and matrix attributes
        defaultValue: (create, edit, query) - Manually set the default value. Default values are values that are not written to file. For example, for blendShapes the default value is automatically set to 1.0 and these values are not written to disk. For skinClusters the value is 0.0. If all weights should be forced to be written to disk, set a defaultValue = -1.0.
        deformer: (create, edit, multiuse, query) - Specify the deformer whose weights should be exported or imported. If a pattern is supplied for the deformer name (i.e: cluster*), only the first deformer that matches the pattern will be imported/exported unless used in conjunction with the -skip option
        export: (create, edit, query) - Export the given deformer
        format: (create, edit, query) - Specify either "XML" or "JSON" as the file extension to save as.
        ignoreName: (create, edit, query) - Ignore the names of the layers on import, just use the order of the layers instead. This can be used when joint names have been changed. Leaving it on only name that match on import will be write to the deformer.
        im: (create, edit, query) - Import weights to the specified deformer. See the method flag for details on how the weights will be mapped to the destination deformer.
        method: (create, edit, query) - Specify the method used to map the weight during import. Valid values are: "index", "nearest", "barycentric", "bilinear" and "over". The "index" method uses the vertex index to map the weights onto the object. This is most useful when the destination object shares the same topology as the exported data. The "nearest" method finds the nearest vertex in the imported data set and sets the weight value to that value. This is best used when mapping a higher resolution mesh to a lower resolution. The "barycentric" and "bilinear" methods are only supported with polygon mesh exported with -vc/vertexConnections flag. The "barycentric" method finds the nearest triangle of the input geometry and rescales the weights at the triangle vertices according to the barycentric weights to each vertex of the nearest triangle. The "bilinear" method finds the nearest convex quad of the input geometry and rescales the weights at the quad vertices according to the bilinear weights to each vertex of the nearest convex quad. For non-quad polygon, the "bilinear" method will fall back to "barycentric" method. The "over" method is similar to the "index" method but the weights on the destination mesh are not cleared prior to mapping, so that unmatched indices keep their weights intact.
        path: (create, edit, query) - The path to the given file. Default to the current project.
        positionTolerance: (create, edit, query) - The position tolerance is used to determine the radius of search for the nearest method. This flag is only used with import. Defaults to a huge number.
        remap: (create, edit, multiuse, query) - Remap maps source regular expression to destination format. It maps any name that matches the regular expression (before the semi-colon) to the expression format (after the semi-colon). For example, -remap "test:(.*);$1" will rename all items in the test namespace to the global namespace. Accepts $1, $2, .., $9 as pattern holders in the expression format. Remap flag must be used together with import or export. When working with import, the name of the object from the xml file matching the regular expression is remapped to object in scene. When working with export, the name of the object from the scene matching the regular expression is remapped to object in xml file.
        shape: (create, edit, multiuse, query) - Specify the source shape. Export will write out all the deformers on the shape node into one file. If a pattern is supplied for the shape name (i.e: pCylinder*), only the first shape that matches the pattern will be imported/exported unless used in conjunction with the -skip option.
        skip: (create, edit, multiuse, query) - Skip any deformer, shape, or layer that whose name matches the given regular expression string
        vertexConnections: (create, edit, query) - Export vertex connection information, which is required for -m/-method "barycentric" and "bilinear". The flag is only used with -ex/-export flag. The vertex connection information is automatically loaded during import if available in xml file.
        weightPrecision: (create, edit, query) - Sets the output decimal precision for exported weights. The default value is 3.
        weightTolerance: (create, edit, query) - The weight tolerance is used to decide if a given weight value is close enough to the default value that it does not need to be included. This flag is only used with export. The default value is .001.
        worldSpace: (create, edit, query) - For spatially based association methods (nearest), the position should be based on the world space position rather then the local object space.

    Handles turning on and off the evaluation manager method of evaluating the DG. Query the 'mode' flag to see all available evaluation modes. The special mode 'off' disables the evaluation manager. The scheduling override flags 'nodeTypeXXX' force certain node types to use specific scheduling types, even though the node descriptions might indicate otherwise. Use with caution; certain nodes may not react well to alternative scheduling types. Only one scheduling type override will be in force at a time, the most restrictive one. In order, they are untrusted, globally serialized, locally serialized, and parallel. The node types will however remember all overrides. For example, if you set a node type override to be untrusted, then to be parallel it will continue to use the untrusted override. If you then turn off the untrusted override, the scheduling will advance to the parallel one. The actual node scheduling type is always superceded by the overrides. For example, a serial node will still be considered as parallel if the node type has the parallel override set, even though 'serial' is a more restrictive scheduling type. See the 'dbpeek' command 'graph' operation with arguments 'evaluationGraph' and 'scheduling' to see what scheduling type any particular node will end up using after the hierarchy of overrides and native scheduling types is applied.

    Args:
        cycleCluster: (create, query) - Returns a list of nodes that are stored together with the given one in a cycle cluster. The list will be empty when the evaluation mode is not active or the node is not in a cycle.
        disableInfo: (query) - Returns a list of strings that contain the reasons that the evaluation manager has been disabled (as distinct from it being deliberately turned off, e.g. because an unsupported node type or attribute value was encountered). If the list is empty then the evaluation manager is operating normally.
        empty: (query) - Valid in query mode only. Checks to see if the evaluation graph has any nodes in it. This is independent of the current mode.
        enabled: (query) - Valid in query mode only. Checks to see if the evaluation manager is currently enabled. This is independent of the current mode.
        fallbackTriggered: (query) - Valid in query mode only. Checks to see if fallback serial evaluation has been triggered. Will be true if errors during parallel execution have forced a fallback to serial mode. Will reset to false if the mode is changed again after the fallback was triggered.
        idleAction: (create, query) - This flag sets the actions EM will perform on idle. It accepts the following values:  0 - No action 1 - Graph Rebuild 2 - EM Manipulation Preparation 3 - Graph Rebuild and EM Manipulation Preparation   Where:  Graph Rebuild will rebuild the evaluation graph on an idle event as soon as it is able to do so. EM ManipulationPreparation will get the evaluation manager to perform all the steps necessary for EM manipulation to be available after the next idle event.   Note: These idle actions only apply to the graph attached to the normal context. All other graphs will be built according to their own rules.  The disadvantage of enabling idle actions is that for some workflows that are changing the graph frequently, or very large graphs, the graph build and manipulation preparation time may impact the workflow. If workflows are impacted it is suggested to turn idle actions off by passing this flag a value of 0.
        idleBuild: (create, query) - This flag is obsolete. Please use the -idleAction flag with a value of 1 in order to activate evaluation graph rebuild on idle.
        invalidate: (create, query) - This flag invalidates the graph. Value is used to control auto rebuilding on idle (false) or forced (true). This command should be used as a last resort. In query mode it checks to see if the graph is valid.
        manipulation: (create, query) - This flag is used to activate evaluation manager manipulation support.
        manipulationPrevalidation: (create, query) - This flag is used to activate evaluation manager manipulation prevalidation. Prevalidation checks for known patterns in manipulation.  In case of a successful prevalidation, there is no need to use dirty propagation in the first frame of manipulation to validate that EM manipulation can safely be used, and fast manipulation can start right away.
        manipulationReady: (query) - Valid in query mode only. Checks to see if the evaluation manager manipulation is currently ready/allowed. This is independent of the current mode.
        mode: (create, query) - Changes the current evaluation mode in the evaluation manager. Supported values are "off", "serial" and "parallel".
        downstreamFrom: (create, query) - Find the DG nodes that are immediately downstream of the named one in the evaluation graph. Note that the connectivity is via evaluation mode connections, not DG connections. In query mode the graph is walked and any nodes downstream of the named one are returned. The return type is alternating pairs of values that represent the graph level and the node name, e.g. if you walk downstream from A in the graph A -> B -> C then the return will be the array of strings ("0","A","1","B","2","C"). Scripts can deconstruct this information into something more visually recognizable. Note that cycles are likely to be present so any such scripts would have to handle them. 			In query mode, this flag needs a value.
        nodeTypeGloballySerialize: (create, query) - This flag is used only when the evaluation manager is in "parallel" mode but can be set at anytime. It activates or deactivates the override to force global serial scheduling for the class name argument(s) in the evaluation manager. Legal object values are class type names: e.g. "transform", "skinCluster", "mesh". When queried without specified nodes, it returns the list of nodes with the global serial scheduling override active. Scheduling overrides take precedence over all of the node and node type scheduling rules. Use with caution; certain nodes may not react well to alternative scheduling types.
        nodeTypeParallel: (create, query) - This flag is used only when the evaluation manager is in "parallel" mode but can be set at anytime. It activates or deactivates the override to force parallel scheduling for the class name argument(s) in the evaluation manager. Legal object values are class type names: e.g. "transform", "skinCluster", "mesh". When queried without specified nodes, it returns the list of nodes with the parallel scheduling override active. Scheduling overrides take precedence over all of the node and node type scheduling rules. Use with caution; certain nodes may not react well to alternative scheduling types.
        nodeTypeSerialize: (create, query) - This flag is used only when the evaluation manager is in "parallel" mode but can be set at anytime. It activates or deactivates the override to force local serial scheduling for the class name argument(s) in the evaluation manager. Legal object values are class type names: e.g. "transform", "skinCluster", "mesh". When queried without specified nodes, it returns the list of nodes with the local serial scheduling override active. Scheduling overrides take precedence over all of the node and node type scheduling rules. Use with caution; certain nodes may not react well to alternative scheduling types.
        nodeTypeUntrusted: (create, query) - This flag is used only when the evaluation manager is in "parallel" mode but can be set at anytime. It activates or deactivates the override to force untrusted scheduling for the class name argument(s) in the evaluation manager. Legal object values are class type names: e.g. "transform", "skinCluster", "mesh". When queried without specified nodes, it returns the list of nodes with the untrusted scheduling override active. Scheduling overrides take precedence over all of the node and node type scheduling rules. Use with caution; certain nodes may not react well to alternative scheduling types. Untrusted scheduling will allow nodes to be evaluated in a critical section, separately from any other node evaluation. It should be used only as a last resort since the lost parallelism caused by untrusted nodes can greatly reduce performance.
        upstreamFrom: (create, query) - Find the DG nodes that are immediately upstream of the named one in the evaluation graph. Note that the connectivity is via evaluation mode connections, not DG connections. In query mode the graph is walked and any nodes upstream of the named one are returned. The return type is alternating pairs of values that represent the graph level and the node name, e.g. if you walk upstream from C in the graph A -> B -> C then the return will be the array of strings ("0","C","1","B","2","A"). Scripts can deconstruct this information into something more visually recognizable. Note that cycles are likely to be present so any such scripts would have to handle them. 			In query mode, this flag needs a value.
        reduceGraphRebuild: (create, query) - This flag is used to activate evaluation manager mode to minimize rebuild when animated node are connected to EM prepopulated plug.
        safeMode: (create, query) - This flag activates/deactivates parallel evaluation safe mode. When enabled, parallel execution will fall back to serial when evaluation graph is missing dependencies. Detection is happening on scheduling of parallel evaluation, which means potential fallback will happen at the next evaluation. WARNING: This mode should be disabled with extreme caution. It will prevent parallel mode from falling back to serial mode when an invalid evaluation is detected. Sometimes the evaluation will still work correctly in those situations and use of this flag will keep the peak parallel performance running. However since the safe mode is used to catch invalid evaluation disabling it may also cause problems with evaluation, anything from invalid values, missing evaluation, or even crashes.

If your output framerate is much higher than your input frame rate (approximate, as the input timestep is not assumed to be regular) the lirp and triangle will interpolate (usually) and the rest will either average, or use the closest sample (depending on the phase and frequency of the input).

    When a node is frozen none of its inputs will be requested when they change, the node will use the inputs that existed at the time of freezing until the node is unfrozen. A node can be frozen in one of two ways; either directly, via setting the "frozen" attribute on the node to be true, or indirectly, via setting the "frozenAffected" extension attribute on the node to be true. This command lets you freeze nodes based on various criteria. See the flags for the types of criteria the command uses to decide what to freeze or unfreeze. The nodes that are selected are frozen directly. The nodes affected by directly frozen nodes, considering the argument settings, are frozen indirectly. If the frozen attribute, visibililty, or display layer mode has an input connection then the frozen state will not propagate because the node could be unfrozen or become visible at playback time. In query mode this command will find the nodes with each of the frozen states set (frozen, frozenAffected, and neither).

    Args:
        allNodes: (create, query) - Select which nodes are to be used for the operation. If it is not set then the selection list will be used. If nothing is selected all nodes in the scene will be used. This flag can be used in query mode to find the set of frozen nodes in the scene. It can also be used in create mode with filters (displayLayers, invisible, or frozen) to target a specific subset of nodes in the scene.
        displayLayers: (create, query) - If this flag is enabled then the display layers on the list to be processed will be walked. Any nodes they control will be added to the processing list, providing the display layer visibility control is off and not connected. Note: Animated visibility or enabled states will be treated as matches to be thorough. No attempt is made to check for static animation.
        downstream: (create, query) - If this flag is enabled then the frozen state will attempt to propagate downstream from the selected nodes. e.g. the mesh shape deformations being controlled by a skeleton rig.
        forceDownstream: (create, query) - If this flag is enabled then the frozen state will attempt to propagate downstream from the selected nodes. e.g. the mesh shape deformations being controlled by a skeleton rig. Unlike the downstream flag though this one will freeze downstream nodes even if they have other, unfrozen, inputs.
        frozen: (create, query) - If this flag is enabled then the list of nodes to be processed will be filtered out so that only nodes with the frozen attribute already set are included. Otherwise all nodes being processed will first have their frozen attribute set before propagating the frozen state. This flag would only be used if nodes were previously frozen and the command is used to propagate the frozen state through the graph.
        invisible: (create, query) - If this flag is enabled then the invisible nodes on the list to be processed will be walked. Any nodes below them in the DAG hierarchy will be added to the processing list, providing the visibility attribute is not connected. Note: Animated visibility states will be treated as a match to be thorough. No attempt is made to check for static animation.
        noFreeze: (create, query) - This flag previews the nodes that will be frozen without actually freezing them.
        unfreeze: (create, query) - If this flag is enabled then the nodes being processed will have their frozen state turned off instead of on.

If you have 'action=ghost' set then you will be modifying the current values of the ghosting parameters and then applying them to selected objects.

    Args:
        action: (create) - Define the actions to be performed by the command. Legal values are "ghost", "unghost", and "unghostAll". The "ghost" will try to enable ghosting on all _visible_ DAG objects in the selection list. Imtermediate transform nodes will only be ghosted if axis display are active.
        allGhostedObjects: (edit) - Only works in edit mode, specifying that the edits are to be applied to all ghosted objects instead of just the selected ones.
        allInRange: (create, edit, query) - In create mode, define the default value for whether keyframe mode should use every keyframe in the playback range or use the specified values. In edit mode, modify the all-in-range value for all ghosts. In create mode with the "ghost" action, also set the custom ghost all-in-range value for the selected objects.
        customFrames: (create, edit, multiuse, query) - In create mode, define the default value for the list of custom ghost frames. In edit mode, modify the custom ghost frames for all ghosts. The special frame number "-9999999" is used to remove all custom frames, circumventing a quirk in the command engine that does not allow passing an empty list. In create mode with the "ghost" action, also set the custom ghost frames for the selected objects.
        enable: (create, query) - Enables or disables ghost visibility on the entire scene. This does not modify any of the node ghosting attributes, it only globally enables or disables the drawing of any ghosts that have been defined on nodes. This is a preference-based flag so its value will persist between sessions, even if you load a new file with different ghost attribute settings.
        farOpacity: (create, edit, query) - In create mode, define the default value for the opacity value for ghosts farthest away from the current time. In edit mode, modify the opacity value of ghosts farthest away from the current time for all ghosts. In create mode with the "ghost" action, also set the opacity value of ghosts farthest away from the current time for the selected objects.
        frames: (query) - Queries the current set of ghost frames on the selected objects based on the ghosting mode, parameters set on the object, and the current time when relevant. Ignores the state of the ghosting enabled flag.
        geometryFilter: (create, edit, query) - In create mode, enable or disable the default ghost geometry filter. In create mode with the "ghost" action set, also filter the selection to omit geometry nodes if this flag is false.
        ghostedObjects: (query) - Only works in query mode to find the names of all currently ghosted DAG nodes.
        ghostsStep: (create, edit, query) - In create mode, define the default value for the number of steps (keyframes or frames) between ghosts. In edit mode, modify the number of steps (keyframes or frames) between ghosts. In create mode with the "ghost" action, also set the default number of steps (keyframes or frames) between ghosts for the selected objects.
        hierarchy: (create, edit, query) - Enables or disables the ghost hierarchy default value. When no ghosting action is set it does not modify any of the node ghosting attributes, it only sets the preference for how future commands will filter the list of affected nodes. When used in conjunction with a ghosting action it will fist set the preference value and then use that new value as a filter on the ghosting action. If a ghosting action is specified without this flag then the current value of the preference is used in its place. This is a preference-based flag so its value will persist between sessions, even if you load a new file with different ghost attribute settings.
        jointFilter: (create, edit, query) - In create mode, enable or disable the default ghost joint filter. In create mode with the "ghost" action set, also filter the selection to omit joint nodes if this flag is false.
        locatorFilter: (create, edit, query) - In create mode, enable or disable the default ghost locator filter. In create mode with the "ghost" action set, also filter the selection to omit locator nodes if this flag is false.
        mode: (create, edit, query) - Define the default mode for ghosting actions. Legal values are "preAndPost", "pre", "post", "custom", and "keyframes".
        nearOpacity: (create, edit, query) - In create mode, define the default value for the opacity value for ghosts nearest to the current time. In edit mode, modify the opacity value of ghosts nearest to the current time for all ghosts. In create mode with the "ghost" action, also set the opacity value of ghosts nearest to the current time for the selected objects.
        postColor: (create, edit, query) - In create mode, define the default value for the color of ghosts after the current time. In edit mode, modify the color of ghosts after the current time for all ghosts. In create mode with the "ghost" action, also set the color of ghosts after the current time for the selected objects.
        postFrames: (create, edit, query) - In create mode, define the default value for the number of ghosted frames after the current time. In edit mode, modify the number of ghosted frames after the current time for all ghosts. In create mode with the "ghost" action, also set the default number of ghosted frames after the current time for the selected objects.
        preColor: (create, edit, query) - In create mode, define the default value for the color of ghosts before the current time. In edit mode, modify the color of ghosts before the current time for all ghosts. In create mode with the "ghost" action, also set the color of ghosts before the current time for the selected objects.
        preFrames: (create, edit, query) - In create mode, define the default value for the number of ghosted frames before the current time. In edit mode, modify the number of ghosted frames before the current time for all ghosts. In create mode with the "ghost" action, also set the default number of ghosted frames before the current time for the selected objects.
        preset: (create, edit, query) - Define the default mode for ghosting presets. Legal values are "1s", "2s", "4s", "5s", "10s", and "Custom". Setting anything other than "Custom" fixes ghosts at 3 pre frames, 3 post frames, with a step value of the preset (e.g. "2s" means show ghosts at every second frame or keyframe)
        resetAll: (create, edit) - Reset all ghosting options to their default values. Use with caution!
        useDriver: (create, edit, query) - In create mode, enable or disable the default ghost use driver value. In edit mode, modify the use driver value of all existing ghosts. In create mode with the "ghost" action, also set the use driver value for the selected objects.

    The handle command is used to create, edit, and query a handle within Maya.  The standard edit (-e) and query (-q) flags are used for edit and query functions.

    Args:
        autoPriority: (edit) - Specifies that this handle's priority is assigned automatically.  The assigned priority will be based on the hierarchy distance from the root of the skeletal chain to the start joint of the handle.
        connectEffector: (create, edit) - This option is set to true as default, meaning that end-effector translate is connected with the endJoint translate.
        createCurve: (create) - Specifies if a curve should automatically be created for the ikSplineHandle.
        createRootAxis: (create) - Specifies if a root transform should automatically be created above the joints affected by the ikSplineHandle. This option is used to prevent the root flipping singularity on a motion path.
        curve: (create, edit, query) - Specifies the curve to be used by the ikSplineHandle. Joints will be moved to align with this curve. This flag is mandatory if you use the -freezeJoints option.
        disableHandles: (edit) - set given handles to full fk (ikBlend attribute = 0.0)
        enableHandles: (edit) - set given handles to full ik (ikBlend attribute = 1.0)
        endEffector: (create, edit, query) - Specifies the end-effector of the handle's joint chain. The end effector may be specified with a joint or an end-effector.  If a joint is specified, an end-effector will be created at the same position as the joint and this new end-effector will be used as the end-effector.
        exists: (edit) - Indicates if the specified handle exists or not.
        forceSolver: (create, edit, query) - Forces the solver to be used everytime. It could also be known as animSticky. So, after you set the first key the handle is sticky.
        freezeJoints: (create, edit) - Forces the curve, specfied by -curve option, to align itself along the existing joint chain. When false, or unspecified, the joints will be moved to positions along the specified curve.
        jointList: (edit) - Returns the list of joints that the handle is manipulating.
        name: (create, edit, query) - Specifies the name of the handle.
        numSpans: (create) - Specifies the number of spans in the automatically generated curve of the ikSplineHandle.
        parentCurve: (create) - Specifies if the curve should automatically be parented to the parent of the first joint affected by the ikSplineHandle.
        positionWeight: (create, edit, query) - Specifies the position/orientation weight of a handle. This is used to compute the "distance" between the goal position and the end-effector position.  A positionWeight of 1.0 computes the distance as the distance between positions only and ignores the orientations.  A positionWeight of 0.0 computes the distance as the distance between the orientations only and ignores the positions.  A positionWeight of 0.5 attempts to weight the distances equally but cannot actually compute this due to unit differences. Because there is no way to add linear units and angular units.
        priority: (create, edit, query) - Sets the priority of the handle.  Logically, all handles with a lower number priority are solved before any handles with a higher numbered priority.  (All handles of priority 1 are solved before any handles of priority 2 and so on.)  Handle priorities must be ] 0.
        rootOnCurve: (create, edit, query) - Specifies if the root is locked onto the curve of the ikSplineHandle.
        rootTwistMode: (create, edit, query) - Specifies whether the start joint is allowed to twist or not. If not, then the required twist is distributed over the remaining joints. This applies to all the twist types.
        setupForRPsolver: (edit) - If the flag is set and ikSolver is ikRPsolver, call RPRotateSetup for the new ikHandle. It is for ikRPsolver only.
        simplifyCurve: (create) - Specifies if the ikSplineHandle curve should be simplified.
        snapCurve: (create) - Specifies if the curve should automatically snap to the first joint affected by the ikSplineHandle.
        snapHandleFlagToggle: (create, edit, query) - Specifies that the handle position should be snapped to the end-effector position if the end-effector is moved by the user.  Setting this flag on allows you to use forward kinematics to pose or adjust your skeleton and then to animate it with inverse kinematics.
        snapHandleToEffector: (edit) - All handles are immediately moved so that the handle position and orientation matches the end-effector position and orientation.
        solver: (create, edit, query) - Specifies the solver.  The complete list of available solvers may not be known until run-time because some of the solvers may be implemented as plug-ins.  Currently the only valid solver are ikRPsolver, ikSCsolver and ikSplineSolver.
        startJoint: (create, edit, query) - Specifies the start joint of the handle's joint chain.
        sticky: (create, edit, query) - Specifies that this handle is "sticky". Valid values are "off", "sticky", "superSticky". Sticky handles are solved when the skeleton is being manipulated interactively.  If a character has sticky feet, the solver will attempt to keep them in the same position as the user moves the character's root.  If they were not sticky, they would move along with the root.
        twistType: (create, edit, query) - Specifies the type of interpolation to be used by the ikSplineHandle.  The interpolation options are "linear", "easeIn", "easeOut", and "easeInOut".
        weight: (create, edit, query) - Specifies the handles weight in error calculations.  The weight only applies when handle goals are in conflict and cannot be solved simultaneously.  When this happens, a solution is computed that weights the "distance" from each goal to the solution by the handle's weight and attempts to minimize this value.  The weight must be ]= 0.

        absolute: (create, edit, query) - The joint center position is in absolute world coordinates. (This is the default.)
        angleX: (create, edit, query) - Set the x-axis angle. When queried, this flag returns a float.

        automaticLimits: (create) - Meaningful only in edit mode. It sets the joint to appropriate hinge joint with joint limits. It modifies the joint only if (a) it connects exactly to two joints (one parent, one child), (b) it does not lie on the line drawn between the two connected joints, and the plane it forms with the two connected joints is perpendicular to one of its rotation axes.
        children: (edit) - It tells the command to apply all the edit options not only to the selected joints, but also to their descendent joints in the DAG.
        component: (create, edit) - Use with the -position switch to position the joint relative to its parent (like -relative) but to compute new positions for all children joints so their world coordinate positions do not change.
        degreeOfFreedom: (create, edit, query) - Specifies the degrees of freedom for the IK. Valid strings consist of non-duplicate letters from x, y, and z. The letters in the string indicate what rotations are to be used by IK. The order a letter appear in the string does not matter. Examples are x, yz, xyz. When queried, this flag returns a string. Modifying dof will change the locking state of the corresponding rotation attributes. The rule is: if an rotation is turned into a dof, it will be unlocked if it is currently locked. When it is turned into a non-dof, it will be locked if it is not currently locked.

        limitSwitchX: (create, edit, query) - Use the limit the x-axis rotation? When queried, this flag returns a boolean.
        limitSwitchY: (create, edit, query) - Use the limit the y-axis rotation? When queried, this flag returns a boolean.
        limitSwitchZ: (create, edit, query) - Use the Limit the z-axis rotation? When queried, this flag returns a boolean.
        limitX: (create, edit, query) - Set lower and upper limits on the x-axis of rotation.  Also turns on the joint limit. When queried, this flag returns 2 floats.
        limitY: (create, edit, query) - Set lower and upper limits on the y-axis of rotation.  Also turns on the joint limit. When queried, this flag returns 2 floats.
        limitZ: (create, edit, query) - Set lower and upper limits on the z-axis of rotation.  Also turns on the joint limit. When queried, this flag returns 2 floats.
        name: (create, edit, query) - Specifies the name of the joint. When queried, this flag returns a string.
        orientJoint: (edit) - The argument can be one of the following strings: xyz, yzx, zxy, zyx, yxz, xzy, none.  It modifies the joint orientation and scale orientation so that the axis indicated by the first letter in the argument will be aligned with the vector from this joint to its first child joint. For example, if the argument is "xyz", the x-axis will point towards the child joint.  The alignment of the remaining two joint orient axes are dependent on whether or not the -sao/-secondaryAxisOrient flag is used. If the -sao flag is used, see the documentation for that flag for how the remaining axes are aligned.  In the absence of a user specification for the secondary axis orientation, the rotation axis indicated by the last letter in the argument will be aligned with the vector perpendicular to first axis and the vector from this joint to its parent joint.  The remaining axis is aligned according the right hand rule.  If the argument is "none", the joint orientation will be set to zero and its effect to the hierarchy below will be offset by modifying the scale orientation.  The flag will be ignored if:  A. the joint has non-zero rotations when the argument is not "none".  B. the joint does not have child joint, or the distance to the child joint is zero when the argument is not "none".  C. either flag -o or -so is set.
        orientation: (create, edit, query) - The joint orientation. When queried, this flag returns 3 floats.
        position: (create, edit, query) - Specifies the position of the center of the joint. This position may be relative to the joint's parent or in absolute world coordinates (see -r and -a below). When queried, this flag returns 3 floats.
        radius: (create, edit, query) - Specifies the joint radius.
        relative: (create, edit, query) - The joint center position is relative to the joint's parent.
        rotationOrder: (create, edit, query) - The rotation order of the joint. The argument can be one of the following strings: xyz, yzx, zxy, zyx, yxz, xzy.
        scale: (create, edit, query) - Scale of the joint. When queried, this flag returns 3 floats.
        scaleCompensate: (create, edit, query) - It sets the scaleCompenstate attribute of the joint to the given argument. When this is true, the scale of the parent joint will be compensated before any rotation of this joint is applied, so that the bone to the joint is scaled but not the bones to its child joints. When queried, this flag returns an boolean.
        scaleOrientation: (create, edit, query) - Set the orientation of the coordinate axes for scaling. When queried, this flag returns 3 floats.
        secondaryAxisOrient: (edit) - The argument can be one of the following strings: xup, xdown, yup, ydown, zup, zdown, none.  This flag is used in conjunction with the -oj/orientJoint flag. It specifies the scene axis that the second axis should align with. For example, a flag combination of "-oj yzx -sao yup" would result in the y-axis pointing down the bone, the z-axis oriented with the scene's positive y-axis, and the x-axis oriented according to the right hand rule.
        setPreferredAngles: (edit) - Meaningful only in the edit mode. It sets the preferred angles to the current joint angles.
        stiffnessX: (create, edit, query) - Set the stiffness (from 0 to 100.0) for x-axis. When queried, this flag returns a float.
        stiffnessY: (create, edit, query) - Set the stiffness (from 0 to 100.0) for y-axis. When queried, this flag returns a float.
        stiffnessZ: (create, edit, query) - Set the stiffness (from 0 to 100.0) for z-axis. When queried, this flag returns a float.
        symmetry: (create, edit) - Create a symmetric joint from the current joint.
        symmetryAxis: (create, edit) - This flag specifies the axis used to mirror symmetric joints. Any combination of x, y, z can be used. This option is only used when the symmetry flag is set to True.
        zeroScaleOrient: (edit) - It sets the scale orientation to zero and compensate the change by modifing the translation and joint orientation for joint or rotation for general transform of all its child transformations.  The flag will be ignored if the flag -so is set.

    This command creates/edits/queries a jointLattice deformer. The name of the created/edited object is returned. Usually you would make use of this functionality through the higher level flexor command.

    Args:
        after: (create, edit) - If the default behavior for insertion/appending into/onto the existing chain is not the desired behavior then this flag can be used to force the command to place the deformer node after the selected node in the chain even if a new geometry shape has to be created in order to do so. Works in create mode (and edit mode if the deformer has no geometry added yet).
        afterReference: (create, edit) - The -afterReference flag is used to specify deformer ordering in a hybrid way that choses between -before and -after automatically. If the geometry being deformed is referenced then the -after mode is used when adding the new deformer, otherwise the -before mode is used. The net effect when using -afterReference to build deformer chains is that internal shape nodes in the deformer chain will only appear at reference file boundaries, leading to lightweight deformer networks that may be more amicable to reference swapping.
        before: (create, edit) - If the default behavior for insertion/appending into/onto the existing chain is not the desired behavior then this flag can be used to force the command to place the deformer node before the selected node in the chain even if a new geometry shape has to be created in order to do so. Works in create mode (and edit mode if the deformer has no geometry added yet).
        components: (query) - Returns the components used by the deformer
        creasing: (create, edit, query) - Affects the bulging of lattice points on the inside of the bend.  Positive/negative values cause the points to bulge outwards/inwards. Default value is 0.0. When queried, this flag returns a float.
        deformerTools: (query) - Returns the name of the deformer tool objects (if any) as string string ...
        exclusive: (create, query) - Puts the deformation set in a deform partition.
        frontOfChain: (create, edit) - This command is used to specify that the new deformer node should be placed ahead (upstream) of existing deformer and skin nodes in the shape's history (but not ahead of existing tweak nodes). The input to the deformer will be the upstream shape rather than the visible downstream shape, so the behavior of this flag is the most intuitive if the downstream deformers are in their reset (hasNoEffect) position when the new deformer is added. Works in create mode (and edit mode if the deformer has no geometry added yet).
        geometry: (edit, multiuse, query) - The specified object will be added to the list of objects being deformed by this deformer object, unless the -rm flag is also specified. When queried, this flag returns string string string ...
        geometryIndices: (query) - Complements the -geometry flag in query mode. Returns the multi index of each geometry.
        ignoreSelected: (create) - Tells the command to not deform objects on the current selection list
        includeHiddenSelections: (create) - Apply the deformer to any visible and hidden objects in the selection list. Default is false.
        joint: (create) - Specifies the joint which will be used to drive the bulging behaviours.
        lengthIn: (create, edit, query) - Affects the location of lattice points on the parent bone.  Positive/negative values cause the points to move away/towards the joint. Changing this parameter also modifies the regions affected by the creasing, rounding and width parameters. Default value is 0.0. When queried, this flag returns a float.
        lengthOut: (create, edit, query) - Affects the location of lattice points on the child bone. Positive/negative values cause the points to move away/towards the joint. Changing this parameter also modifies the regions affected by the creasing, rounding and width parameters. Default value is 0.0. When queried, this flag returns a float.
        lowerBindSkin: (create) - Specifies the node which is performing the bind skin operation on the geometry associated with the lower bone.
        lowerTransform: (create) - Specifies which dag node is being used to rigidly transform the lower part of the lattice which this node is going to deform. If this flag is not specified an identity matrix will be assumed.
        name: (create) - Used to specify the name of the node being created.
        parallel: (create, edit) - Inserts the new deformer in a parallel chain to any existing deformers in the history of the object. A blendShape is inserted to blend the parallel results together. Works in create mode (and edit mode if the deformer has no geometry added yet).
        prune: (edit) - Removes any points not being deformed by the deformer in its current configuration from the deformer set.
        remove: (edit, multiuse) - Specifies that objects listed after the -g flag should be removed from this deformer.
        rounding: (create, edit, query) - Affects the bulging of lattice points on the outside of the bend. Positive/negative values cause the points to bulge outwards/inwards. Default value is 0.0. When queried, this flag returns a float.
        selectedComponents: (query) - Returns the components used by the deformer that are currently selected. This intersects the current selection with the components affected by the deformer.
        split: (create, edit) - Branches off a new chain in the dependency graph instead of inserting/appending the deformer into/onto an existing chain. Works in create mode (and edit mode if the deformer has no geometry added yet).
        upperBindSkin: (create) - Specifies the node which is performing the bind skin operation on the geometry associated with the upper bone.
        upperTransform: (create) - Specifies which dag node is being used to rigidly transform the upper part of the lattice which this node is going to deform. If this flag is not specified an identity matrix will be assumed.
        useComponentTags: (create) - When this flag is specified a setup using componentTags will be created. This means no groupId, groupParts, tweak or objectSet nodes will be created and connected to the new deformer.
        widthLeft: (create, edit, query) - Affects the bulging of lattice points on the left side of the bend. Positive/negative values cause the points to bulge outwards/inwards. Default value is 0.0. When queried, this flag returns a float.
        widthRight: (create, edit, query) - Affects the bulging of lattice points on the right side of the bend. Positive/negative values cause the points to bulge outwards/inwards. Default value is 0.0. When queried, this flag returns a float.

        animation: (create) - Where this command should get the animation to act on.  Valid values are "objects," "keys," and "keysOrObjects" Default: "keysOrObjects."  (See Description for details.)
        attribute: (create, multiuse) - List of attributes to select       In query mode, this flag needs a value.
        breakdown: (create, edit, query) - Sets the breakdown state for the key.  Returns an integer.  Default is false.  The breakdown state of a key cannot be set in the same command as it is moved (i.e., via the -tc or -fc flags).
        clipTime: (create) - Modifies the final time where a key is inserted using an offset, pivot, and scale.
        controlPoints: (create) - This flag explicitly specifies whether or not to include the control points of a shape (see "-s" flag) in the list of attributes. Default: false.  (Not valid for "pasteKey" cmd.) In query mode, this flag needs a value.
        eval: (create, query) - Returns the value(s) of the animCurves when evaluated (without regard to input connections) at the times given by the -t/time or -f/float flags.  Cannot be used in combination with other query flags, and cannot be used with time ranges (-t "5:10"). When no -t or -f flags appear on the command line, the evals are queried at the current time.  Query returns a float[].
        float: (create, multiuse) - value uniquely representing a non-time-based key (or key range) on a time-based animCurve.  Valid floatRange include single values (-f 10) or a string with a lower and upper bound, separated by a colon (-f "10:20")       In query mode, this flag needs a value.
        floatChange: (create, edit, query) - How much (with -relative) or where (with -absolute) to move keys (on non-time-input animation curves) along the x (float) axis. Returns float[] when queried.
        hierarchy: (create) - Hierarchy expansion options.  Valid values are "above," "below," "both," and "none." (Not valid for "pasteKey" cmd.) In query mode, this flag needs a value.
        includeUpperBound: (create) - When the -t/time or -f/float flags represent a range of keys, this flag determines whether the keys at the upper bound of the range are included in the keyset. Default value: true.  This flag is only valid when the argument to the -t/time flag is a time range with a lower and upper bound.  (When used with the "pasteKey" command, this flag refers only to the time range of the target curve that is replaced, when using options such as "replace," "fitReplace," or "scaleReplace."  This flag has no effect on the curve pasted from the clipboard.)
        index: (create, multiuse) - index of a key on an animCurve       In query mode, this flag needs a value.
        indexValue: (create, query) - Query-only flag that returns an int for the key's index.

        lastSelected: (create, query) - When used in queries, this flag returns requested values for the last selected key.
        name: (create, query) - Returns the names of animCurves of specified nodes, attributes or keys.
        option: (create, edit) - Valid values are "move," "insert," "over," and "segmentOver." When you "move" a key, the key will not cross over (in time) any keys before or after it. When you "insert" a key, all keys before or after (depending upon the -timeChange value) will be moved an equivalent amount. When you "over" a key, the key is allowed to move to any time (as long as a key is not there already). When you "segmentOver" a set of keys (this option only has a noticeable effect when more than one key is being moved) the first key (in time) and last key define a segment (unless you specify a time range). That segment is then allowed to move over other keys, and keys will be moved to make room for the segment.
        relative: (create) - Move amounts are relative to a key's current position.
        selected: (create, query) - When used in queries, this flag returns requested values for any active keys.
        shape: (create) - Consider attributes of shapes below transforms as well, except "controlPoints".  Default: true.  (Not valid for "pasteKey" cmd.) In query mode, this flag needs a value.
        tickDrawSpecial: (create, edit) - Sets the special drawing state for this key when it is drawn as a tick in the timeline.
        time: (create, multiuse) - time uniquely representing a key (or key range) on a time-based animCurve. See the code examples below on how to format for a single frame or frame ranges.       In query mode, this flag needs a value.
        timeChange: (create, edit, query) - How much (with -relative) or where (with -absolute) to move keys (on time-input animation curves) along the x (time) axis.  Returns float[] when queried.

        annotation: (create, edit, query) - Annotate the control with an extra string value.
        backgroundColor: (create, edit, query) - The background color of the control. The arguments correspond to the red, green, and blue color components. Each component ranges in value from 0.0 to 1.0. When setting backgroundColor, the background is automatically enabled, unless enableBackground is also specified with a false value.
        defineTemplate: (create) - Puts the command in a mode where any other flags and arguments are parsed and added to the command template specified in the argument. They will be used as default arguments in any subsequent invocations of the command when templateName is set as the current template.
        display: (edit, query) - narrow | wide What columns to display.  When "narrow", time and value will be displayed, when "wide" tangent information will be displayed as well
        docTag: (create, edit, query) - Add a documentation flag to the control.  The documentation flag has a directory structure. (e.g., -dt render/multiLister/createNode/material)
        dragCallback: (create, edit) - Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:  global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods)  The proc returns a string array that is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type.  Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers CTRL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTRL, 3 == CTRL + SHIFT.  In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form:  def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ):  The values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above.  The other way to specify the callback in Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys "dragControl", "x", "y", "modifiers".  The "dragControl" value is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be "print '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'")
        dropCallback: (create, edit) - Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:  global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int $y, int $type)  The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback. $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link.  In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form:  def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ):  The values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above.  The other way to specify the callback in Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys "dragControl", "dropControl", "messages", "x", "y", "type".  The "dragControl" value is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be "print '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'")
        enable: (create, edit, query) - The enable state of the control.  By default, this flag is set to true and the control is enabled.  Specify false and the control will appear dimmed or greyed-out indicating it is disabled.
        enableBackground: (create, edit, query) - Enables the background color of the control.
        enableKeyboardFocus: (create, edit, query) - If enabled, the user can navigate to the control with the tab key and select values with the keyboard or mouse. This flag would typically be used to turn off focus support from controls that get it by default, like Edit and List controls. If disabled, text in text fields can still be selected with the mouse but cannot be copied (except on Linux when "Middle Click Paste" is enabled).
        exists: (create) - Returns whether the specified object exists or not. Other flags are ignored.
        fullPathName: (query) - Return the full path name of the widget, which includes all the parents.
        height: (create, edit, query) - The height of the control.  The control will attempt to be this size if it is not overruled by parent layout conditions.
        highlightColor: (create, edit, query) - The highlight color of the control. The arguments correspond to the red, green, and blue color components. Each component ranges in value from 0.0 to 1.0.
        isObscured: (query) - Return whether the control can actually be seen by the user. The control will be obscured if its state is invisible, if it is blocked (entirely or partially) by some other control, if it or a parent layout is unmanaged, or if the control's window is invisible or iconified.
        manage: (create, edit, query) - Manage state of the control.  An unmanaged control is not visible, nor does it take up any screen real estate.  All controls are created managed by default.
        noBackground: (create, edit) - Clear/reset the control's background. Passing true means the background should not be drawn at all, false means the background should be drawn.  The state of this flag is inherited by children of this control.
        numberOfPopupMenus: (query) - Return the number of popup menus attached to this control.
        parent: (create, query) - The parent layout for this control.
        popupMenuArray: (query) - Return the names of all the popup menus attached to this control.
        preventOverride: (create, edit, query) - If true, this flag prevents overriding the control's attribute via the control's right mouse button menu.
        statusBarMessage: (create, edit) - Extra string to display in the status bar when the mouse is over the control.
        useTemplate: (create) - Forces the command to use a command template other than the current one.
        visible: (create, edit, query) - The visible state of the control.  A control is created visible by default.  Note that a control's actual appearance is also dependent on the visible state of its parent layout(s).

        docTag: (create, edit, query) - Add a documentation flag to the control.  The documentation flag has a directory structure. (e.g., -dt render/multiLister/createNode/material)
        dragCallback: (create, edit) - Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:  global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods)  The proc returns a string array that is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type.  Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers CTRL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTRL, 3 == CTRL + SHIFT.  In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form:  def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ):  The values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above.  The other way to specify the callback in Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys "dragControl", "x", "y", "modifiers".  The "dragControl" value is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be "print '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'")
        dropCallback: (create, edit) - Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site.  The MEL version of the callback is of the form:  global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int $y, int $type)  The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback. $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link.  In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify the callback.  The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.  In that case, the Python callback should have the form:  def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ):  The values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above.  The other way to specify the callback in Python is to specify a string to be executed.  In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard Python format operator.  The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys "dragControl", "dropControl", "messages", "x", "y", "type".  The "dragControl" value is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be "print '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'")
        enable: (create, edit, query) - The enable state of the control.  By default, this flag is set to true and the control is enabled.  Specify false and the control will appear dimmed or greyed-out indicating it is disabled.
        enableBackground: (create, edit, query) - Enables the background color of the control.
        enableKeyboardFocus: (create, edit, query) - If enabled, the user can navigate to the control with the tab key and select values with the keyboard or mouse. This flag would typically be used to turn off focus support from controls that get it by default, like Edit and List controls. If disabled, text in text fields can still be selected with the mouse but cannot be copied (except on Linux when "Middle Click Paste" is enabled).
        exists: (create) - Returns whether the specified object exists or not. Other flags are ignored.
        fullPathName: (query) - Return the full path name of the widget, which includes all the parents.
        height: (create, edit, query) - The height of the control.  The control will attempt to be this size if it is not overruled by parent layout conditions.
        highlightColor: (create, edit, query) - The highlight color of the control. The arguments correspond to the red, green, and blue color components. Each component ranges in value from 0.0 to 1.0.
        isObscured: (query) - Return whether the control can actually be seen by the user. The control will be obscured if its state is invisible, if it is blocked (entirely or partially) by some other control, if it or a parent layout is unmanaged, or if the control's window is invisible or iconified.
        manage: (create, edit, query) - Manage state of the control.  An unmanaged control is not visible, nor does it take up any screen real estate.  All controls are created managed by default.
        noBackground: (create, edit) - Clear/reset the control's background. Passing true means the background should not be drawn at all, false means the background should be drawn.  The state of this flag is inherited by children of this control.
        numberOfPopupMenus: (query) - Return the number of popup menus attached to this control.
        parent: (create, query) - The parent layout for this control.
        popupMenuArray: (query) - Return the names of all the popup menus attached to this control.
        precision: (edit, query) - Controls the number of digits to the right of the decimal point that will be displayed for float-valued channels. Default is 3.  Queried, returns an int.
        preventOverride: (create, edit, query) - If true, this flag prevents overriding the control's attribute via the control's right mouse button menu.
        rowAttach: (create, edit, multiuse) - Arguments are : column, attachment type, offset. Possible attachments are: top | bottom | both. Specifies attachment types and offsets for the entire row.
        statusBarMessage: (create, edit) - Extra string to display in the status bar when the mouse is over the control.
        timeAnnotation: (create, edit, query) - Annotate the time field with an extra string value.
        useTemplate: (create) - Forces the command to use a command template other than the current one.
        valueAnnotation: (create, edit, query) - Annotate the value field with an extra string value.
        visible: (create, edit, query) - The visible state of the control.  A control is created visible by default.  Note that a control's actual appearance is also dependent on the visible state of its parent layout(s).
        visibleChangeCommand: (create, edit, query) - Command that gets executed when visible state of the control changes.
        width: (create, edit, query) - The width of the control.  The control will attempt to be this size if it is not overruled by parent layout conditions.

    This command is used to manage the membership of a keying group.  Keying groups allow users to effectively manage related keyframe data, allowing keys on attributes in the keying group to be set and edited as a single entity.

    Args:
        activator: (edit, query) - Sets the selected node(s) as activators for the given keying group. In query mode, returns list of objects that activate the given keying group
        addElement: (edit) - Adds the list of items to the given set.  If some of the items cannot be added to the set because they are in another set which is in the same partition as the set to edit, the command will fail.
        afterFilters: (edit) - Default state is false. This flag is valid in edit mode only. This flag is for use on sets that are acted on by deformers such as sculpt, lattice, blendShape. The default edit mode is to edit the membership of the group acted on by the deformer. If you want to edit the group but not change the membership of the deformer, set the flag to true.
        anyMember: (create) - An operation which tests whether any of the given items are members of the given set.
        category: (create, edit, query) - Sets the keying group's category. This is what the global, active keying group filter will use to match.
        clear: (edit) - An operation which removes all items from the given set making the set empty.
        color: (create, edit, query) - Defines the hilite color of the set. Must be a value in range [-1, 7] (one of the user defined colors).  -1 marks the color has being undefined and therefore not having any affect. Only the vertices of a vertex set will be displayed in this color.
        copy: (create) - Copies the members of the given set to a new set. This flag is for use in creation mode only.
        edges: (create, query) - Indicates the new set can contain edges only. This flag is for use in creation or query mode only. The default value is false.
        editPoints: (create, query) - Indicates the new set can contain editPoints only. This flag is for use in creation or query mode only. The default value is false.
        empty: (create) - Indicates that the set to be created should be empty. That is, it ignores any arguments identifying objects to be added to the set. This flag is only valid for operations that create a new set.
        excludeDynamic: (create) - When creating the keying group, exclude dynamic attributes.
        excludeRotate: (create) - When creating the keying group, exclude rotate attributes from transform-type nodes.
        excludeScale: (create) - When creating the keying group, exclude scale attributes from transform-type nodes.
        excludeTranslate: (create) - When creating the keying group, exclude translate attributes from transform-type nodes. For example, if your keying group contains joints only, perhaps you only want to include rotations in the keying group.
        excludeVisibility: (create) - When creating the keying group, exclude visibility attribute from transform-type nodes.
        facets: (create, query) - Indicates the new set can contain facets only. This flag is for use in creation or query mode only. The default value is false.
        flatten: (edit) - An operation that flattens the structure of the given set. That is, any sets contained by the given set will be replaced by its members so that the set no longer contains other sets but contains the other sets' members.
        forceElement: (edit) - For use in edit mode only. Forces addition of the items to the set. If the items are in another set which is in the same partition as the given set, the items will be removed from the other set in order to keep the sets in the partition mutually exclusive with respect to membership.
        include: (edit) - Adds the list of items to the given set.  If some of the items cannot be added to the set, a warning will be issued. This is a less strict version of the -add/addElement operation.
        intersection: (create) - An operation that returns a list of items which are members of all the sets in the list.
        isIntersecting: (create) - An operation which tests whether the sets in the list have common members.
        isMember: (create) - An operation which tests whether all the given items are members of the given set.
        layer: (create) - OBSOLETE. DO NOT USE.
        minimizeRotation: (create, edit, query) - This flag only affects the attribute contained in the immediate keyingGroup. It does not affect attributes in sub-keyingGroups. Those will need to set minimizeRotation on their respective keyingGroups
        name: (create) - Assigns string as the name for a new set. This flag is only valid for operations that create a new set.
        noIntermediate: (create, query) - Excludes intermediate objects when querying set members or using the subtract, union, itersection, or isIntersecting flags.
        noSurfaceShader: (create) - If set is renderable, do not connect it to the default surface shader.  Flag has no meaning or effect for non renderable sets. This flag is for use in creation mode only. The default value is false.
        noWarnings: (create) - Indicates that warning messages should not be reported such as when trying to add an invalid item to a set. (used by UI)
        nodesOnly: (query) - This flag is usable with the -q/query flag but is ignored if used with another queryable flags. This flag modifies the results of the set membership query such that when there are attributes (e.g. sphere1.tx) or components of nodes included in the set, only the nodes will be listed. Each node will only be listed once, even if more than one attribute or component of the node exists in the set.
        remove: (edit) - Removes the list of items from the given set.
        removeActivator: (edit) - Removes the selected node(s) as activators for the given keying group.
        renderable: (create, query) - This flag indicates that a special type of set should be created. This type of set (shadingEngine as opposed to objectSet) has certain restrictions on its membership in that it can only contain renderable elements such as lights and geometry. These sets are referred to as shading groups and are automatically connected to the "renderPartition" node when created (to ensure mutual exclusivity of the set's members with the other sets in the partition). This flag is for use in creation or query mode only. The default value is false which means a normal set is created.
        setActiveFilter: (create, edit, query) - Sets the global, active keying group filter, which will affect activation of keying groups. Only keying groups with categories that match the filter will be activated. If the setActiveFilter is set to "NoKeyingGroups", keying groups will not be activated at all. If the setActiveFilter is set to "AllKeyingGroups", we will activate any keying group rather than just those with matching categories.
        size: (query) - Use the size flag to query the length of the set.
        split: (create) - Produces a new set with the list of items and removes each item in the list of items from the given set.
        subtract: (create) - An operation between two sets which returns the members of the first set that are not in the second set.
        text: (create, edit, query) - Defines an annotation string to be stored with the set.
        union: (create) - An operation that returns a list of all the members of all sets listed.
        vertices: (create, query) - Indicates the new set can contain vertices only. This flag is for use in creation or query mode only. The default value is false.

The global tangent type is used by the setKeyframe command when tangent types have not been specifically applied, except in combination with flags such as 'i/insert' which preserve the shape of the curve.  It is also used when keys are set from the menu. The only flags that can appear on a keyTangent command with the 'g/global' flag are 'itt/inTangentType', 'ott/outTangentType' and 'wt/weightedTangents'.

        includeUpperBound: (create) - When the -t/time or -f/float flags represent a range of keys, this flag determines whether the keys at the upper bound of the range are included in the keyset. Default value: true.  This flag is only valid when the argument to the -t/time flag is a time range with a lower and upper bound.  (When used with the "pasteKey" command, this flag refers only to the time range of the target curve that is replaced, when using options such as "replace," "fitReplace," or "scaleReplace."  This flag has no effect on the curve pasted from the clipboard.)
        index: (create, multiuse) - index of a key on an animCurve       In query mode, this flag needs a value.

        pluginTangentTypes: (query) - Returns a list of the plug-in tangent types that have been loaded. Return type is a string array.
        relative: (create, edit) - Changes to tangent positions are relative to the current position.
        shape: (create) - Consider attributes of shapes below transforms as well, except "controlPoints".  Default: true.  (Not valid for "pasteKey" cmd.) In query mode, this flag needs a value.
        stepAttributes: (create, edit) - The setKeyframe command will automatically set tangents for boolean and enumerated attributes to step.

    """
    This command creates a lattice deformer that will deform the selected objects. If the object centered flag is used, the initial lattice will fit around the selected objects. The lattice will be selected when the command is completed. The lattice deformer has an associated base lattice. Only objects which are contained by the base lattice will be deformed by the lattice.

    Args:
        after: (create, edit) - If the default behavior for insertion/appending into/onto the existing chain is not the desired behavior then this flag can be used to force the command to place the deformer node after the selected node in the chain even if a new geometry shape has to be created in order to do so. Works in create mode (and edit mode if the deformer has no geometry added yet).
        afterReference: (create, edit) - The -afterReference flag is used to specify deformer ordering in a hybrid way that choses between -before and -after automatically. If the geometry being deformed is referenced then the -after mode is used when adding the new deformer, otherwise the -before mode is used. The net effect when using -afterReference to build deformer chains is that internal shape nodes in the deformer chain will only appear at reference file boundaries, leading to lightweight deformer networks that may be more amicable to reference swapping.
        before: (create, edit) - If the default behavior for insertion/appending into/onto the existing chain is not the desired behavior then this flag can be used to force the command to place the deformer node before the selected node in the chain even if a new geometry shape has to be created in order to do so. Works in create mode (and edit mode if the deformer has no geometry added yet).
        commonParent: (create) - Group the base lattice and the deformed lattice under a common transform. This means that you can resize the lattice without affecting the deformation by resizing the common transform.
        components: (query) - Returns the components used by the deformer
        deformerTools: (query) - Returns the name of the deformer tool objects (if any) as string string ...
        divisions: (create, edit, query) - Set the number of lattice slices in x, y, z. Default is 2, 5, 2. When queried, this flag returns float float float. When you change the number of divisions, any tweaking or animation of lattice points must be redone.
        dualBase: (create) - Create a special purpose ffd deformer node which accepts 2 base lattices. The default is off which results in the creation of a normal ffd deformer node. Intended for internal usage only.
        exclusive: (create, query) - Puts the deformation set in a deform partition.
        freezeMapping: (create, edit, query) - The base position of the geometries points is fixed at the time this flag is set.  When mapping is frozen, moving the geometry with respect to the lattice will not cause the deformation to be recomputed.
        frontOfChain: (create, edit) - This command is used to specify that the new deformer node should be placed ahead (upstream) of existing deformer and skin nodes in the shape's history (but not ahead of existing tweak nodes). The input to the deformer will be the upstream shape rather than the visible downstream shape, so the behavior of this flag is the most intuitive if the downstream deformers are in their reset (hasNoEffect) position when the new deformer is added. Works in create mode (and edit mode if the deformer has no geometry added yet).
        geometry: (edit, multiuse, query) - The specified object will be added to the list of objects being deformed by this deformer object, unless the -rm flag is also specified. When queried, this flag returns string string string ...
        geometryIndices: (query) - Complements the -geometry flag in query mode. Returns the multi index of each geometry.
        ignoreSelected: (create) - Tells the command to not deform objects on the current selection list
        includeHiddenSelections: (create) - Apply the deformer to any visible and hidden objects in the selection list. Default is false.
        latticeReset: (edit) - Reset the lattice to match its base position. This will undo any deformations that the lattice is causing. The lattice will only deform points that are enclosed within the lattice's reset (base) position.
        ldivisions: (create, edit, query) - Set the number of local lattice slices in x, y, z.
        name: (create) - Used to specify the name of the node being created.
        objectCentered: (create) - Centers the lattice around the selected object(s) or components. Default is off which centers the lattice at the origin.
        outsideFalloffDistance: (create) - Set the falloff distance used when the setting for transforming points outside of the base lattice is set to 2. The distance value is a positive number which specifies the size of the falloff distance as a multiple of the base lattice size, thus a value of 1.0 specifies that only points up to the base lattice width/height/depth away are transformed. A value of 0.0 is equivalent to an outsideLattice value of 0 (i.e. no points outside the base lattice are transformed). A huge value is equivalent to transforming an outsideLattice value of 1 (i.e. all points are transformed).
        outsideLattice: (create) - Set the mode describing how points outside the base lattice are transformed. 0 (the default) specifies that no outside points are transformed. 1 specifies that all outside points are transformed, and 2 specifies that only those outside points which fall within the "falloff distance" (see the -ofd/outsideFalloffDistance flag) are transformed. When querying, the current setting for the lattice is returned.
        parallel: (create, edit) - Inserts the new deformer in a parallel chain to any existing deformers in the history of the object. A blendShape is inserted to blend the parallel results together. Works in create mode (and edit mode if the deformer has no geometry added yet).
        position: (create) - Used to specify the position of the newly created lattice.
        prune: (edit) - Removes any points not being deformed by the deformer in its current configuration from the deformer set.
        remove: (edit, multiuse) - Specifies that objects listed after the -g flag should be removed from this deformer.
        removeTweaks: (edit) - Remove any lattice deformations caused by moving lattice points. Translations/rotations and scales on the lattice itself are not removed.
        rotation: (create) - Used to specify the initial rotation of the newly created lattice.
        scale: (create) - Used to specify the initial scale of the newly created lattice.
        selectedComponents: (query) - Returns the components used by the deformer that are currently selected. This intersects the current selection with the components affected by the deformer.
        split: (create, edit) - Branches off a new chain in the dependency graph instead of inserting/appending the deformer into/onto an existing chain. Works in create mode (and edit mode if the deformer has no geometry added yet).
        useComponentTags: (create) - When this flag is specified a setup using componentTags will be created. This means no groupId, groupParts, tweak or objectSet nodes will be created and connected to the new deformer.

    This command mimics what various manipulators do to support Evaluation-Manager-accelerated manipulation.  This command should be use for testing, debugging and benchmarking purposes. Manipulations are described using a string representing a JSON object. This object must have a member named "session" containing an array, where each member of that array represents a manipulation transaction, i.e. plugs set by a single manipulation action.  Each of these transactions is also an array of plugs to set.  A plug to set is an object with a "plug" member, which is a string describing the plug to be manipulated, and a "value" member, which is the value to set to this plug.  Note that only plugs with attributes of type "double" or "double3" can currently be set and the value must be a number or an array of 3 numbers. A session can be thought of as the global action of a manipulation, from the time the manipulator is grabbed to the moment it is released, including the movements in between.

    This command creates a functional deformer of the specified type that will deform the selected objects.  The deformer consists of three nodes: The deformer driver that gets connected to the history of the selected objects, the deformer handle transform that controls position and orientation of the axis of the deformation and the deformer handle that maintains the deformation parameters. The type of the deformer handle shape created depends on the specified type of the deformer.  The deformer handle will be positioned at the center of the selected objects' bounding box and oriented to match the orientation of the leading object in the selection list.  The deformer handle transform will be selected when the command is completed.

    Args:
        after: (create, edit) - If the default behavior for insertion/appending into/onto the existing chain is not the desired behavior then this flag can be used to force the command to place the deformer node after the selected node in the chain even if a new geometry shape has to be created in order to do so. Works in create mode (and edit mode if the deformer has no geometry added yet).
        afterReference: (create, edit) - The -afterReference flag is used to specify deformer ordering in a hybrid way that choses between -before and -after automatically. If the geometry being deformed is referenced then the -after mode is used when adding the new deformer, otherwise the -before mode is used. The net effect when using -afterReference to build deformer chains is that internal shape nodes in the deformer chain will only appear at reference file boundaries, leading to lightweight deformer networks that may be more amicable to reference swapping.
        autoParent: (create) - Parents the deformer handle under the selected object's transform. This flag is valid only when a single object is selected.
        before: (create, edit) - If the default behavior for insertion/appending into/onto the existing chain is not the desired behavior then this flag can be used to force the command to place the deformer node before the selected node in the chain even if a new geometry shape has to be created in order to do so. Works in create mode (and edit mode if the deformer has no geometry added yet).
        commonParent: (create) - Creates a new transform and parents the selected object and the deformer handle under it.  This flag is valid only when a single object is selected.
        components: (query) - Returns the components used by the deformer
        defaultScale: (create) - Sets the scale of the deformation handle to 1.  By default the deformation handle is scaled to the match the largest dimension of the selected objects' bounding box. [deformerFlags] The attributes of the deformer handle shape can be set upon creation, edited and queried as normal flags using either the long or the short attribute name.  e.g.
        deformerTools: (query) - Returns the name of the deformer tool objects (if any) as string string ...
        exclusive: (create, query) - Puts the deformation set in a deform partition.
        frontOfChain: (create, edit) - This command is used to specify that the new deformer node should be placed ahead (upstream) of existing deformer and skin nodes in the shape's history (but not ahead of existing tweak nodes). The input to the deformer will be the upstream shape rather than the visible downstream shape, so the behavior of this flag is the most intuitive if the downstream deformers are in their reset (hasNoEffect) position when the new deformer is added. Works in create mode (and edit mode if the deformer has no geometry added yet).
        geometry: (edit, multiuse, query) - The specified object will be added to the list of objects being deformed by this deformer object, unless the -rm flag is also specified. When queried, this flag returns string string string ...
        geometryIndices: (query) - Complements the -geometry flag in query mode. Returns the multi index of each geometry.
        ignoreSelected: (create) - Tells the command to not deform objects on the current selection list
        includeHiddenSelections: (create) - Apply the deformer to any visible and hidden objects in the selection list. Default is false.
        name: (create) - Used to specify the name of the node being created.
        parallel: (create, edit) - Inserts the new deformer in a parallel chain to any existing deformers in the history of the object. A blendShape is inserted to blend the parallel results together. Works in create mode (and edit mode if the deformer has no geometry added yet).
        prune: (edit) - Removes any points not being deformed by the deformer in its current configuration from the deformer set.
        remove: (edit, multiuse) - Specifies that objects listed after the -g flag should be removed from this deformer.
        selectedComponents: (query) - Returns the components used by the deformer that are currently selected. This intersects the current selection with the components affected by the deformer.
        split: (create, edit) - Branches off a new chain in the dependency graph instead of inserting/appending the deformer into/onto an existing chain. Works in create mode (and edit mode if the deformer has no geometry added yet).
        type: (create) - Specifies the type of deformation. The current valid deformation types are:  bend, twist, squash, flare, sine and wave
        useComponentTags: (create) - When this flag is specified a setup using componentTags will be created. This means no groupId, groupParts, tweak or objectSet nodes will be created and connected to the new deformer.

    This command playblasts the current playback range. Sound is optional.

    Args:
        activeEditor: (create) - This flag will return the current model editor that would be used for playblast. It does not invoke playblast itself.
        cameraSetup: (create, multiuse) - Information about camera setup. The first string defines a camera setup MEL procedure. The camera setup procedure will be invoked before executing a playblast. The second string argument which is used as a camera identifier and is appended to the root file name to specify the final output file name(s). The command will fail there is not a pair of strings supplied to the argument.
        clearCache: (create) - When true, all previous temporary playblast files will be deleted before the new playblast files are created and the remaining temporary playblast files will be deleted when the application quits. Any playblast files that were explicitly given a name by the user will not be deleted.
        codecOptions: (create) - Brings up the OS specific dialog for setting playblast codec options, and does not run the playblast.
        combineSound: (create) - Combine the trax sounds into a single track. This might force a resampling of the sound if the sound paramters don't match up.
        completeFilename: (create) - When set, this string specifies the exact name of the output image. In contrast with the -f/filename flag, -cf/completeFilename does not append any frame number or extension string at the end of the filename. Additionally, playblast will not delete the image from disk after it is displayed. This flag should not be used in conjunction with -f/filename.
        compression: (create) - Specify the compression to use for the movie file.  To determine which settings are available on your system, use the `playblast -options` command. This will display a system-specific dialog with supported compression formats. When the 'format' flag is 'image', this flag is used to pass in the desired image format. If the format is 'image' and the compression flag is ommitted, the output format specified via the Render Globals preference (see -format) will be used. If compression is set to 'none', the iff image format will be used.
        editorPanelName: (create) - This optional flag specifies the name of the model editor or panel, which is to be used for playblast. The current model editor or panel won't be used for playblast unless its name is specified. Flag usage is specific to invoking playblast.
        endTime: (create) - Specify the end time of the playblast.  Default is the end time of the playback range displayed in the Time Slider. Overridden by -frame.
        filename: (create) - The filename to use for the output of this playblast. If the file already exists, a confirmation box will be displayed if playblast is performed interactively.  If playblast is executed from the command line and the file already exists, it will abort.
        forceOverwrite: (create) - Overwrite existing playblast files which may have the the same name as the one specified with the "-f" flag
        format: (create) - The format for the playblast output.    ValueDescription   "movie" This option selects a platform-specific default movie format. On Linux and Mac OSX the default movie format is Quicktime. On Windows the default movie format is Audio Video Interleave.    "avi" Set the format to Audio Video Interleave (Windows only)   "qt" Set the format to QuickTime (all platforms).   "avfoundation" Write movie by AVFoundation (Mac only).   "image" Outputs a sequence of image files. The image format will be the Output Format specified using Window > RenderEditors > RenderSettings > CommonTab. The resulting files use the value of the "-f" flag as a prefix, with an appended frame number, as in "myFile.0007.iff"   "iff" Same as "image"    The default value of the -fmt/format flag is "movie". Depending on the selected format, a platform-specific default application will be used to view results. For image sequences, the default application is "fcheck". For movies, the default application is Windows Media Player (on Windows), Quicktime Player (on Mac OSX), and Lqtplay (on Linux). Users can specify different applications via Maya's application preferences.
        frame: (create, multiuse) - List of frames to blast. One frame specified per flag. The frames can be specified in any order but will be output in an ordered sequence. When specified this flag will override any start/end range
        framePadding: (create) - Number of zeros used to pad file name. Typically set to 4 to support fcheck.
        height: (create) - Height of the final image. This value will be clamped if larger than the width of the active window. Windows: If not using fcheck, the width and height must each be divisible by 4.
        indexFromZero: (create) - Output frames starting with file.0000.ext and incrementing by one. Typically frames use the Maya time as their frame number. This option can only be used for frame based output formats.
        offScreen: (create) - When set, this toggle allow playblast to use an offscreen buffer to render the view. This allows playblast to work when the application is iconified, or obscured.
        offScreenViewportUpdate: (create) - When set, this toggle allows playblast to update the viewport while rendering with the offscreen buffer.
        options: (create) - Brings up a dialog for setting playblast options, and does not run the playblast.
        percent: (create) - Percentage of current view size  to use during blasting. Accepted values are integers between 10 and 100.  All other values are clamped to be within this range.  A value of 25 means 1/4 of the  current view size; a  value of 50  means half the current view size; a value of 100 means full size.  (Default is 50.)
        quality: (create) - Specify the compression quality factor to use for the movie file. Value should be in the 0-100 range
        rawFrameNumbers: (create) - Playblast typically numbers its frames sequentially, starting at zero. This flag will override the default action and frames will be numbered using the actual frames specified by the -frame or -startFrame/-endFrame flags.
        replaceAudioOnly: (create) - When set, this string dictates that only the audio will be replaced when the scene is re-playblasted.
        replaceEndTime: (create) - Specify the end time of a replayblast of an existing playblast.  Default is the start time of the playback range displayed in the Time Slider. Overridden by -frame.
        replaceFilename: (create) - When set, this string specifies the name of an input playblast file which will have frames replaced according to the replace start and end times.
        replaceStartTime: (create) - Specify the start time of a replayblast of an existing playblast.  Default is the start time of the playback range displayed in the Time Slider. Overridden by -frame.
        sequenceTime: (create) - Use sequence time
        showOrnaments: (create) - Sets whether or not model view ornaments (e.g. the axis icon) should be displayed
        sound: (create) - Specify the sound node to be used during playblast
        startTime: (create) - Specify the start time of the playblast.  Default is the start time of the playback range displayed in the Time Slider. Overridden by -frame.
        throwOnError: (create) - Playblast is tolerant of failures in most situations. When set, this toggle allows playblast to throw an error on these failures.
        useTraxSounds: (create) - Use sounds from TRAX.
        viewer: (create) - Specify whether a viewer should be launched for the playblast.  Default is "true".  Runs "fcheck" when -fmt is "image". The player for movie files depends on the OS: Windows uses Microsoft Media Player, Irix uses movieplayer, OSX uses QuickTime.
        width: (create) - Width of the final image. This value will be clamped if larger than the width of the active window. Windows: If not using fcheck, the width and height must each be divisible by 4.
        widthHeight: (create) - Final image's width and height. Values larger than the dimensions of the active window are clamped. A width and height of 0 means to use the window's current size. Windows: If not using fcheck, the width and height must each be divisible by 4.

If the geometry being deformed is referenced then the -after mode is used when adding the new deformer, otherwise the -before mode is used. The net effect when using -afterReference to build deformer chains is that internal shape nodes in the deformer chain will only appear at reference file boundaries, leading to lightweight deformer networks that may be more amicable to reference swapping.

        exclusive: (create, query) - Puts the deformation set in a deform partition.
        frontOfChain: (create, edit) - This command is used to specify that the new deformer node should be placed ahead (upstream) of existing deformer and skin nodes in the shape's history (but not ahead of existing tweak nodes). The input to the deformer will be the upstream shape rather than the visible downstream shape, so the behavior of this flag is the most intuitive if the downstream deformers are in their reset (hasNoEffect) position when the new deformer is added.

When queried, this flag returns a string. Ring mode will tend to produce a contour like ring of points around the sculpt object as it passes through an object while even mode will try to spread the points out as evenly as possible across the surface of the sculpt object.
        maxDisplacement: (create, edit, query) - Defines the maximum amount the sculpt object may move a point on an object which it is deforming. Default is 1.0. When queried, this flag returns a float.

        name: (create) - Used to specify the name of the node being created.
        objectCentered: (create) - Places the sculpt and locator in the center of the bounding box of the selected object(s) or components. Default is off which centers the sculptor and locator at the origin.
        parallel: (create, edit) - Inserts the new deformer in a parallel chain to any existing deformers in the history of the object. A blendShape is inserted to blend the parallel results together. Works in create mode (and edit mode if the deformer has no geometry added yet).

    This command is used to embed a skeleton inside meshes.

    Args:
        mergedMesh: (query) - When specified, the query command merges selected meshes together and returns a Python object representing the merged mesh.
        segmentationMethod: (create) - Specifies which segmentation algorithm to use to determine what is inside the mesh and what is outside the mesh.  By default, boundary-and-fill-and-grow voxelization will be used.  Available algorithms are:   0  : Perfect mesh (no voxelization). This method works for "perfect meshes", i.e. meshes that are closed, watertight, 2-manifold and without self-intersection or interior/hidden geometry.  It segments the interior region of the mesh from the exterior using a pseudo-normal test. It does not use voxelization.  If mesh conditions are not respected, the segmentation is likely to be wrong.  This can make the segmentation process significantly longer and prevent successful skeleton embedding.   1 : Watertight mesh (flood fill). This method works for "watertight meshes", i.e. meshes for which faces completely separate the interior region of the mesh from the exterior.  The mesh can have degenerated faces, wrong face orientation, self-intersection, etc.  The method uses surface voxelization to classify as part of the interior region all voxels intersecting with a mesh face.  It then performs flood-filling from the outside, marking all reached voxels as part of the exterior region of the model.  Finally, all unreached voxels are marked as part of the interior region.  This method works so long as the mesh is watertight, i.e. without holes up to the voxelization resolution. Otherwise, flood-filling reaches the interior region and creates inaccurate segmentation.   2 : Imperfect mesh (flood fill + growing). This method works for meshes where holes could make the flood-filling step reach the interior region of the mesh, but that have face orientation consistent enough so filling them is possible.  First, it uses surface voxelization to classify as part of the interior region all voxels intersecting with a mesh face.  It then alternates flood-filling and growing steps.  The flood-filling tries to reach all voxels from the outside so that unreached voxels are marked as part of the interior region.  The growing step uses a relatively computation-intensive process to check for interior voxels in all neighbors to those already identified.  Any voxel identified as interior is likely to fill holes, allowing subsequent flood-filling steps to identify more interior voxels.   3 : Polygon soup (repair). This method has no manifold or face orientation requirements.  It reconstructs a mesh that wraps the input mesh with a given offset (3 times the voxel size) and uses this perfect 2-manifold mesh to segment the interior region from the exterior region of the model. Because of the offset, it might lose some of the details and merge parts that are proximal. However, this usually is not an issue with common models where body parts are not too close to one another.   99 : Direct skeleton (no embedding). This method does not try to perform embedding.  It simply returns the skeleton in its initial pose without any attempt at embedding inside the meshes, other than placing it in the meshes bounding box.
        segmentationResolution: (create) - Specifies which segmentation resolution to use for the voxel grid.  By default, 256x256x256 voxels will be used.

    The skinCluster command is used for smooth skinning in maya. It binds the selected geometry to the selected joints or skeleton by means of a skinCluster node.  Each point of the bound geometry can be affected by any number of joints. The extent to which each joint affects the motion of each point is regulated by a corresponding weight factor.  Weight factors can be modified using the skinPercent command.  The command returns the name of the new skinCluster.

    Args:
        addInfluence: (edit, multiuse) - The specified transform or joint will be added to the list of transforms that influence the bound geometry. The maximum number of influences will be observed and only the weights of the cv's that the specified transform effects will change. This flag is multi-use.
        addToSelection: (edit) - When used in conjunction with the selectInfluenceVerts flag, causes the vertices afftected by the influence to be added to the current selection, without first de-selecting other vertices.
        after: (create, edit) - If the default behavior for insertion/appending into/onto the existing chain is not the desired behavior then this flag can be used to force the command to place the deformer node after the selected node in the chain even if a new geometry shape has to be created in order to do so. Works in create mode (and edit mode if the deformer has no geometry added yet).
        afterReference: (create, edit) - The -afterReference flag is used to specify deformer ordering in a hybrid way that choses between -before and -after automatically. If the geometry being deformed is referenced then the -after mode is used when adding the new deformer, otherwise the -before mode is used. The net effect when using -afterReference to build deformer chains is that internal shape nodes in the deformer chain will only appear at reference file boundaries, leading to lightweight deformer networks that may be more amicable to reference swapping.
        baseShape: (edit, multiuse) - This flag can be used in conjunction with the -addInfluence flag to specify the shape that will be used as the base shape when an influence object with geometry is added to the skinCluster.  If the flag is not used then the command will make a copy of the influence object's shape and use that as a base shape.
        before: (create, edit) - If the default behavior for insertion/appending into/onto the existing chain is not the desired behavior then this flag can be used to force the command to place the deformer node before the selected node in the chain even if a new geometry shape has to be created in order to do so. Works in create mode (and edit mode if the deformer has no geometry added yet).
        bindMethod: (create, query) - This flag sets the binding method. 0 - Closest distance between a joint and a point of the geometry. 1 - Closest distance between a joint, considering the skeleton hierarchy, and a point of the geometry. 2 - Surface heat map diffusion. 3 - Geodesic voxel binding.  geomBind command must be called after creating a skinCluster with this method.
        components: (query) - Returns the components used by the deformer
        deformerTools: (query) - Returns the name of the deformer tool objects (if any) as string string ...
        dropoffRate: (create, edit, query) - Sets the rate at which the influence of a transform drops as the distance from that transform increases. The valid range is between 0.1 and 10.0.  In Create mode it sets the dropoff rate for all the bound joints.  In Edit mode the flag is used together with the inf/influence flag to set the dropoff rate of a particular influence.  Note: When the flag is used in Edit mode, any custom weights on the skin points the given transform influences will be lost.
        exclusive: (create, query) - Puts the deformation set in a deform partition.
        forceNormalizeWeights: (edit) - If the normalization mode is none or post, it is possible (indeed likely) for the weights in the skin cluster to no longer add up to 1.  This flag forces all weights to add back to 1 again.
        frontOfChain: (create, edit) - This command is used to specify that the new deformer node should be placed ahead (upstream) of existing deformer and skin nodes in the shape's history (but not ahead of existing tweak nodes). The input to the deformer will be the upstream shape rather than the visible downstream shape, so the behavior of this flag is the most intuitive if the downstream deformers are in their reset (hasNoEffect) position when the new deformer is added. Works in create mode (and edit mode if the deformer has no geometry added yet).
        geometry: (edit, multiuse, query) - The specified object will be added to the list of objects being deformed by this deformer object, unless the -rm flag is also specified. When queried, this flag returns string string string ...
        geometryIndices: (query) - Complements the -geometry flag in query mode. Returns the multi index of each geometry.
        heatmapFalloff: (create) - This flag sets the heatmap binding falloff. If set to 0.0 (default) the deformation will be smoother due to many small weights spread over the mesh surface per influence. However, if set to 1.0, corresponding to maximum falloff, the number of influences per point will be reduced and points will tend to be greatly influenced by their closest joint decreasing the overall spread of small weights. This flag only works when using heatmap binding.
        ignoreBindPose: (create, edit) - This flag is deprecated and no longer used.  It will be ignored if used.
        ignoreHierarchy: (create, query) - Deprecated. Use bindMethod flag instead. Disregard the place of the joints in the skeleton hierarchy when computing the closest joints that influence a point of the geometry.
        ignoreSelected: (create) - Tells the command to not deform objects on the current selection list
        includeHiddenSelections: (create) - Apply the deformer to any visible and hidden objects in the selection list. Default is false.
        influence: (edit, query) - This flag specifies the influence object that will be used for the current edit operation. In query mode, returns a string array of the influence objects (joints and transform).       In query mode, this flag can accept a value.
        lockWeights: (edit, query) - Lock the weights of the specified influence object to their current value or to the value specified by the -weight flag.
        maximumInfluences: (create, edit, query) - Sets the maximum number of transforms that can influence a point (have non-zero weight for the point) when the skinCluster is first created or a new influence is added.  Note: When this flag is used in Edit mode any custom weights will be lost and new weights will be reassigned to the whole skin.
        moveJointsMode: (edit) - If set to true, puts the skin into a mode where joints can be moved without modifying the skinning. If set to false, takes the skin out of move joints mode.
        name: (create) - Used to specify the name of the node being created.
        normalizeWeights: (create, edit, query) - This flag sets the normalization mode. 0 - none, 1 - interactive, 2 - post (default) Interactive normalization makes sure the weights on the influences add up to 1.0, always. Everytime a weight is changed, the weights are automatically normalized.  This may make it difficult to perform weighting operations, as the normalization may interfere with the weights the user has set.  Post normalization leaves the weights the user has set as is, and only normalizes the weights at the moment it is needed (by dividing by the sum of the weights).  This makes it easier for users to weight their skins.
        nurbsSamples: (create, edit) - Sets the number of sample points that will be used along an influence curve or in each direction on an influence NURBS surface to influence the bound skin. The more the sample points the more closely the skin follows the influence NURBS curve/surface.
        obeyMaxInfluences: (create, edit, query) - When true, the skinCluster will continue to enforce the maximum influences each time the user modifies the weight, so that any given point is only weighted by the number of influences in the skinCluster's maximumInfluences attribute.
        parallel: (create, edit) - Inserts the new deformer in a parallel chain to any existing deformers in the history of the object. A blendShape is inserted to blend the parallel results together. Works in create mode (and edit mode if the deformer has no geometry added yet).
        polySmoothness: (create, edit) - This flag controls how accurately the skin control points follow a given polygon influence object. The higher the value of polySmoothnmess the more rounded the deformation resulting from a polygonal influence object will be.
        prune: (edit) - Removes any points not being deformed by the deformer in its current configuration from the deformer set.
        recacheBindMatrices: (edit) - Forces the skinCluster node to recache its bind matrices.
        remove: (edit, multiuse) - Specifies that objects listed after the -g flag should be removed from this deformer.
        removeFromSelection: (edit) - When used in conjunction with the selectInfluenceVerts flag, causes the vertices afftected by the influence to be removed from the current selection.
        removeInfluence: (edit, multiuse) - Remove the specified transform or joint from the list of transforms that influence the bound geometry The weights for the affected points are renormalized. This flag is multi-use.
        removeUnusedInfluence: (create, edit, query) - If this flag is set to true then transform or joint whose weights are all zero (they have no effect) will not be bound to the geometry.  Having this option set will help speed-up the playback of animation. In query mode, returns the number of transforms or joints whose weights are all zero.
        selectInfluenceVerts: (edit) - Given the name of a transform, this will select the verts or control points being influenced by this transform, so users may visualize which vertices are being influenced by the transform.
        selectedComponents: (query) - Returns the components used by the deformer that are currently selected. This intersects the current selection with the components affected by the deformer.
        skinMethod: (create, edit, query) - This flag set the skinning method. 0 - classical linear skinning (default). 1 - dual quaternion (volume preserving), 2 - a weighted blend between the two.
        smoothWeights: (edit) - This flag is used to detect sudden jumps in skin weight values, which often indicates bad weighting, and then smooth out those jaggies in skin weights. The argument is the error tolerance ranging from 0 to 1.  A value of 1 means that the algorithm will smooth a vertex only if there is a 100% change in weight values from its neighbors.  The recommended default to use is 0.5 (50% change in weight value from the neighbors).
        smoothWeightsMaxIterations: (edit) - This flag is valid only with the smooth weights flag.  It is possible that not all the vertices detected as needing smoothing can be smoothed in 1 iteration (because all of their neighbors also have bad weighting and need to be smoothed). With more iterations, more vertices can be smoothed.  This flag controls the maximum number of iterations the algorithm will attempt to smooth weights. The default is 2 for this flag.
        split: (create, edit) - Branches off a new chain in the dependency graph instead of inserting/appending the deformer into/onto an existing chain. Works in create mode (and edit mode if the deformer has no geometry added yet).
        toSelectedBones: (create) - geometry will be bound to the selected bones only.
        toSkeletonAndTransforms: (create) - geometry will be bound to the skeleton and any transforms in the hierarchy. If any of the transforms are also bindable objects, assume that only the last object passed to the command is the bindable object. The rest are treated as influences.
        unbind: (edit) - Unbinds the geometry from the skinCluster and deletes the skinCluster node
        unbindKeepHistory: (edit) - Unbinds the geometry from the skinCluster, but keeps the skinCluster node so that its weights can be used when the skin is rebound. To rebind, use the skinCluster command.
        useComponentTags: (create) - When this flag is specified a setup using componentTags will be created. This means no groupId, groupParts, tweak or objectSet nodes will be created and connected to the new deformer.
        useGeometry: (edit) - When adding an influence to a skinCluster, use the geometry parented under the influence transform to determine the weight dropoff of that influence.
        volumeBind: (create) - Creates a volume bind node and attaches it to the new skin cluster node. This node holds hull geometry parameters for a volume based weighting system. This system is used in interactive skinning. The value passed will determine the minimum weight value when initializing the volume. The volume in be increase to enclose all the vertices that are above this value.
        volumeType: (create) - Defines the initial shape of the binding volume (see volumeBind). 0 - Default (currently set to a capsule) 1 - Capsule, 2 - Cylinder.
        weight: (edit) - This flag is only valid in conjunction with the -addInfluence flag. It sets the weight for the influence object that is being added.
        weightDistribution: (create, edit, query) - This flag sets the weight distribution mode. 0 - distance (default), 1 - neighbors When normalizeWeights is in effect, and a weight has been reduced or removed altogether, the sum is usually brought back up to 1.0 by increasing the contributions of the other non-zero weights. However, if there are no other non-zero weights, the algorithm has to create some weights from thin air and distribute the residual weight between them. This attribute controls how that is done. "Distance" - the algorithm calculates weights from the world-space distances from the component to the transforms. "Neighbors" - the algorithm calculates weights from the weights on the neighboring components.
        weightedInfluence: (query) - This flag returns a string array of the influence objects (joints and transform) that have non-zero weighting.

Works in create mode (and edit mode if the deformer has no geometry added yet).
        afterReference: (create, edit) - The -afterReference flag is used to specify deformer ordering in a hybrid way that choses between -before and -after automatically. If the geometry being deformed is referenced then the -after mode is used when adding the new deformer, otherwise the -before mode is used. The net effect when using -afterReference to build deformer chains is that internal shape nodes in the deformer chain will only appear at reference file boundaries, leading to lightweight deformer networks that may be more amicable to reference swapping.
        before: (create, edit) - If the default behavior for insertion/appending into/onto the existing chain is not the desired behavior then this flag can be used to force the command to place the deformer node before the selected node in the chain even if a new geometry shape has to be created in order to do so. Works in create mode (and edit mode if the deformer has no geometry added yet).
        bindState: (create) - Specifying this flag adds in a compensation to ensure the softModed objects preserve their spatial position when softModed. This is required to prevent the geometry from jumping at the time the softMod is created in situations when the softMod transforms at softMod time are not identity.
        components: (query) - Returns the components used by the deformer
        curveInterpolation: (create, multiuse) - Ramp interpolation corresponding to the specified curvePoint position. Integer values of 0-3 are valid, corresponding to "none", "linear", "smooth" and "spline" respectively. This flag may only be used in conjunction with the curvePoint and curveValue flag.
        curvePoint: (create, multiuse) - Position of ramp value on normalized 0-1 scale. This flag may only be used in conjunction with the curveInterpolation and curveValue flags.
        curveValue: (create, multiuse) - Ramp value corresponding to the specified curvePoint position. This flag may only be used in conjunction with the curveInterpolation and curvePoint flags.

        falloffRadius: (create) - Set the falloff radius of the softMod.
        frontOfChain: (create, edit) - This command is used to specify that the new deformer node should be placed ahead (upstream) of existing deformer and skin nodes in the shape's history (but not ahead of existing tweak nodes). The input to the deformer will be the upstream shape rather than the visible downstream shape, so the behavior of this flag is the most intuitive if the downstream deformers are in their reset (hasNoEffect) position when the new deformer is added. Works in create mode (and edit mode if the deformer has no geometry added yet).
        geometry: (edit, multiuse, query) - The specified object will be added to the list of objects being deformed by this deformer object, unless the -rm flag is also specified. When queried, this flag returns string string string ...
        geometryIndices: (query) - Complements the -geometry flag in query mode. Returns the multi index of each geometry.
        ignoreSelected: (create) - Tells the command to not deform objects on the current selection list

        name: (create) - Used to specify the name of the node being created.
        parallel: (create, edit) - Inserts the new deformer in a parallel chain to any existing deformers in the history of the object. A blendShape is inserted to blend the parallel results together. Works in create mode (and edit mode if the deformer has no geometry added yet).
        prune: (edit) - Removes any points not being deformed by the deformer in its current configuration from the deformer set.
        relative: (create) - Enable relative mode for the softMod. In relative mode, Only the transformations directly above the softMod are used by the softMod. Default is off.
        remove: (edit, multiuse) - Specifies that objects listed after the -g flag should be removed from this deformer.
        resetGeometry: (edit) - Reset the geometry matrices for the objects being deformed by the softMod. This flag is used to get rid of undesirable effects that happen if you scale an object that is deformed by a softMod.
        selectedComponents: (query) - Returns the components used by the deformer that are currently selected. This intersects the current selection with the components affected by the deformer.
        split: (create, edit) - Branches off a new chain in the dependency graph instead of inserting/appending the deformer into/onto an existing chain. Works in create mode (and edit mode if the deformer has no geometry added yet).
        useComponentTags: (create) - When this flag is specified a setup using componentTags will be created. This means no groupId, groupParts, tweak or objectSet nodes will be created and connected to the new deformer.
        weightedNode: (create, edit, query) - Transform node in the DAG above the softMod to which all percents are applied. The second node specifies the descendent of the first node from where the transformation matrix is evaluated. Default is the softMod handle.

    This command creates a wire deformer.

    Args:
        after: (create, edit) - If the default behavior for insertion/appending into/onto the existing chain is not the desired behavior then this flag can be used to force the command to place the deformer node after the selected node in the chain even if a new geometry shape has to be created in order to do so. Works in create mode (and edit mode if the deformer has no geometry added yet).
        afterReference: (create, edit) - The -afterReference flag is used to specify deformer ordering in a hybrid way that choses between -before and -after automatically. If the geometry being deformed is referenced then the -after mode is used when adding the new deformer, otherwise the -before mode is used. The net effect when using -afterReference to build deformer chains is that internal shape nodes in the deformer chain will only appear at reference file boundaries, leading to lightweight deformer networks that may be more amicable to reference swapping.
        before: (create, edit) - If the default behavior for insertion/appending into/onto the existing chain is not the desired behavior then this flag can be used to force the command to place the deformer node before the selected node in the chain even if a new geometry shape has to be created in order to do so. Works in create mode (and edit mode if the deformer has no geometry added yet).
        components: (query) - Returns the components used by the deformer
        crossingEffect: (create, edit, query) - Set the amount of convolution effect. Varies from fully convolved at 0 to a simple additive effect at 1 (which is what you get with the filter off). Default is 0.  This filter should make its way into all blend nodes that deal with combining effects from multiple sources.
        deformerTools: (query) - Returns the name of the deformer tool objects (if any) as string string ...
        dropoffDistance: (create, edit, multiuse, query) - Set the dropoff distance (second parameter) for the wire at index (first parameter).
        envelope: (create, edit, query) - Set the envelope value for the deformer. Default is 1.0
        exclusive: (create, query) - Puts the deformation set in a deform partition.
        frontOfChain: (create, edit) - This command is used to specify that the new deformer node should be placed ahead (upstream) of existing deformer and skin nodes in the shape's history (but not ahead of existing tweak nodes). The input to the deformer will be the upstream shape rather than the visible downstream shape, so the behavior of this flag is the most intuitive if the downstream deformers are in their reset (hasNoEffect) position when the new deformer is added. Works in create mode (and edit mode if the deformer has no geometry added yet).
        geometry: (edit, multiuse, query) - The specified object will be added to the list of objects being deformed by this deformer object, unless the -rm flag is also specified. When queried, this flag returns string string string ...
        geometryIndices: (query) - Complements the -geometry flag in query mode. Returns the multi index of each geometry.
        groupWithBase: (create) - Groups the wire with the base wire so that they can easily be moved together to create a ripple effect. Default is false.
        holder: (create, edit, multiuse, query) - Set the specified curve or surface (second parameter  as a holder for the wire at index (first parameter).
        ignoreSelected: (create) - Tells the command to not deform objects on the current selection list
        includeHiddenSelections: (create) - Apply the deformer to any visible and hidden objects in the selection list. Default is false.
        localInfluence: (create, edit, query) - Set the local control a wire has with respect to other wires irrespective of whether it is deforming the surface. Varies from no local effect at 0 to full local control at 1. Default is 0.
        name: (create) - Used to specify the name of the node being created.
        parallel: (create, edit) - Inserts the new deformer in a parallel chain to any existing deformers in the history of the object. A blendShape is inserted to blend the parallel results together. Works in create mode (and edit mode if the deformer has no geometry added yet).
        prune: (edit) - Removes any points not being deformed by the deformer in its current configuration from the deformer set.
        remove: (edit, multiuse) - Specifies that objects listed after the -g flag should be removed from this deformer.
        selectedComponents: (query) - Returns the components used by the deformer that are currently selected. This intersects the current selection with the components affected by the deformer.
        split: (create, edit) - Branches off a new chain in the dependency graph instead of inserting/appending the deformer into/onto an existing chain. Works in create mode (and edit mode if the deformer has no geometry added yet).
        useComponentTags: (create) - When this flag is specified a setup using componentTags will be created. This means no groupId, groupParts, tweak or objectSet nodes will be created and connected to the new deformer.
        wire: (create, edit, multiuse, query) - Specify or query the wire curve name.
        wireCount: (create, edit, query) - Set the number of wires.
